R3QVUB9DT90IEE,"Not great - weak audio, mic, cheapo build quality","You'll get what you pay for (or maybe even less) - definitely wouldn't want to (or honestly be able to) enjoy listening to music with this pair. The microphone quality lacks clarity but is kind of serviceable. The overall build quality is somehow even poorer than I was expecting for the price. I've been using Beyerdynamic Byron in-ears for the past several years as my go-to in ear earbuds but I decided to try these out for a change after my last pair died on me, and I definitely regret not spending the extra dollars on another pair of Byrons.",2,B084X7Y51M,2023,Singapore

RH1H14WGFEEWH,Great cheap earbuds,Exactly what you expect from this company and pretty durable,5,B084X7Y51M,2024,the United States
R2FWKXPGXEIZFZ,Suitable for sleeping,The small profile of the earphones make it perfect for those who like to wear it as they go to sleep,5,B084X7Y51M,2024,the United States
R20GWE7TEAFCQN,Fuzzy audio and the right ear bud stopped working after a month of use.,As the title said.,1,B084X7Y51M,2024,the United States
R1WJ2LKAP8ZSTX,Overpriced; no noticeable sound difference from TW3,"I was forced to replace my TW3 buds repeatedly because they kept spoiling (3 sets in 1.5 years!).

Sound wise TW4 is the same as TW3. The noise cancelling is also the same.

Truth is - Sennheiser buds have the best sound on the market so if you are new to their TW series, you'd think it was worth the money.

My only hope is this set of TW4 buds do not arbitrarily die.

Note****: use ONLY the charging cord they provide you, and not any others. That probably killed my TW3.

Verdict: really not worth the huge price increase. Buy the TW3. It is the same.",3,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,Singapore
RCJ58C5U967IQ,Sounds great,"I had the tw3’s and these are definitely an upgrade. The bass is deep but not overpowering, no need to turn on the bass boost.  Sound quality is very good as well.
Ive had no connectivity issues like the other reviews. They do get a little uncomfortable after extended periods but I do wear them under noise reduction earmuffs.
ANC is pretty good but not great.
Touch controls are easy and not an issue.",5,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R24WW72H305I6G,"Good, but not great","As some have mentioned, audio quality is great! App is great, feature set also. But geez, call quality in phone more apps like Zoom is unacceptable for a $300 pair of headphones. I’ve had to switch to just using my laptop mic as people in the other side are tired of how bad I sound. I hope Sennheiser hears the feedback and does something quickly about it.",4,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R2WM5DN7L3L2AR,Awesome,"I love the fit, sound, and many features you can personalize with the app. I didn’t think anything would top my AP pro, but imo these do.",5,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R1OLSQ1SWNN3BC,Signal Range...NOT Good,Disappointed in the Signal Range of these HIGH DOLLAR Earbuds.  20 FT away.....SIGNAL....BREAKS UP !!!  THAT SUCKS !!!  My Samsung Buds 2 go 25 FT away...before they break up.  Sound quality is GREAT with App.  Noise Cancelling is GREAT.  Battery life is NOT WHAT IS SAID TO BE.  30 percent....after ONLY 3 HOURS.  Have not let them go dead yet.,3,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R2IM91V7JL68FT,Sounds Great;  BUT…,"OK, Set the app up and calibrated the personalized sound equalization.  They are comfortable and sound amazing.  The problem is; they only last for about 5-hours before notification to recharge.  I fully recharged case with ear buds overnight 3 separate days and each time I only got around 5 hours of battery power.  The advertised battery time states 30 hours.  I was expecting at least 7 to 8 hours of usage before requiring recharging.  With that, the charger case must have enough capacity to fully recharge about 5 times.  Disappointed on less than 8 hour charge time.  Exchanging in hopes I was sent a bad pair.",4,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R2G4D55WGXIE7B,Worst earbuds,"I submitted a long review but I guess Amazon won’t allow truthful, thorough reviews. So, this time I’ll write a review that’s void of anything useful besides that my unit had multiple issues such as connection and terrible sound stage. Overall, these are much worse than the MTW3’s I have. Let’s hope this review doesn’t get taken down too.",1,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
RBBJIUQP41H14,Quality of calling bad,this is the second pair. i send the other back because of call muffling on the receiving. the new pair are the same. Am i doing something wrong. 2 pair same problem. maybe somebody can help me. I love the sound but the quality of calling is bad.,4,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
R3Q97KUH9EDUN2,Wonderful.,Great product and easy purchase. Excellent sound,5,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,the United States
RVDVZJDLPUXTN,Came with a completely drained battery (poor storage) and broken,"Left one seems to make a low shhhh noise, while the right one makes a higher pitch SSHHHH that drives me insane. The right headphone does less of noise cancellation than the left one. It makes you feel like you're deaf on one ear and it's uncomfortable.
This was the first sign of failure on my Sony XM4's (twice on different headsets), so I don't have any hopes for this ones.

They also came completely dead. That indicates that the headphones were not stored properly and that's terrible for battery.

Also, the passive noise cancellation is non existent. My $20 pink ""something in chiniese"" brand earbuds do the same job on the passive noise cancellation.
The active noise cancellation is quite poor. I hear the kitchen fan, the clang-clang that the cutlery does when I unload the dishwasher, the noise the baby machine makes and so on. All those drive me insane and I just need to ""turn on silence"" like the Sony XM4's do.

Long story short, I've returned the senheiser crap. I also had purchased the previous model last year and had the same experience.

I guess I just have to suck it up and buy the sony XM4's yearly, pretending it's my mental health / therapy money.",1,B0CTQ5YZYP,2024,Canada
R3JCE126A3LZ6Z,Great quality for its price,As a beginner audiophile earphone it has some of the most unbeatable sound stage quality for its relatively low price.,5,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Singapore
RJIXLGM0G78F9,There are definitely better ones,The fitting for the IEM's are quite bad honestly. The sound is someone okay but there are definitely better sound ones at his price range. The foams provided doesn't fit me at all. Had to use my old foam as a fitting to my ear. Definitely think twice beforehand.,3,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Singapore
R1AB99ENL3F4HJ,Value for money!,"Excited to have received my first non-chifi IEM. I understand the Sennheiser IE200 has some polarizing views, but man, for US$110, I think it's a winner for a pleasurable in-ear hifi experience. I've used Ikko OH10, T-Force(Tangzu) Yuan Li, See Audio Yume, several more and I can safely recommend the IE200 to my friends who are trying to get into the hobby. It drives easily from a dongle DAC on a mobile phone, very light, a little finicky on fit, tip selection is critical, I've to go a size smaller from L to M.",5,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Singapore
R996W1WNCLDH5,Fantastic... If it works...,"Straight to the point, I returned my IE600 after 2 weeks of use. The left driver failed on the second day by constantly disconnecting from the music.

I tried reattaching the cable back to the driver which only provided a temporary solution before the music started to disconnect again.

Sennheiser Customer Service was utterly dismal and their ""solutions"" did not help.

With that out of the way, the SQ on these IEMs are phenomenal. Cymbals are brought to life, Bass is tight and precise, treble is crystal clear, and midrange while is not at the forefront is very good. Listening to Adele in Rollin in the Deep, you can hear her voice echo in the studio as well as hearing the strings vibrating. In Set Fire to the Rain the piano are the stars of the show.

Listening to orchestra music, the soundstage is not as wide as using a multi driver IEM but that's not what you should be looking for. When the drums are beating, you can feel the wind behind every beat and feel it trailing off beautifully. I do not need to say more for the rest of the instruments, they sound spectacular.

There are details this tiny 7mm driver reveals that my multi driver IEMs were unable to bring out unless I really listen closely. Proof that multi driver IEMs are not necessarily better than single driver IEMs.

A very detailed and musical IEM. But only if it works.

Checking with other Sennheiser users via audiophile groups revealed that the disconnecting drivers issue is not uncommon which made me less confident that a repair or replacement would resolve the problem. I tried to find reasons/ excuses to keep it during the time it was with me but the final straw that broke the camel's back was when the Sennheiser Customer Service was not helpful at all(Or rather, their reply was more like they cannot be bothered). It seems like Sennheiser prefers to chase customers away than retain us. Makes me wonder if all that lost business is what led Sennheiser to being sold off to Sonova.

Ultimately, it was with a lot of sadness(and maybe a little bit of relief) that I had to return it for a refund. Fantastic when it works, doesn't work most of the time.

I would rate it 2 stars but seeing all the other 4-5 star reviews of people simping the product led me to giving a lower rating to balance out the review.",1,B0BRPR38JR,2022,Singapore
R1I1C7A6CLLUGQ,Great sound and very Comfortable on the ear,Awesome! very glad with the purchase. Can even use it to sleep.,5,B0BRPR38JR,2021,Singapore
R1BHZX9XNTDKI5,Terrible build quality,"For such a reputable brand, I was shocked at how poor the build quality is. The cord is paper thin and the earphones themselves are cheap quality plastic thats seemingly prone to break on a moments notice. The volume level is extremely low as well, you’ll probably need an amplifier.. these should be 50$ not 200$",1,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Canada
R3MZMIB5Y034A8,Absolutely horrible audio quality,"The quality is absolutely horrible, I decided to buy  a nice pair of wired earbuds for my pc setup and thought i would go with some Sennheiser since they are a renowned audio  company, these have absolutely no base and the audio is just poor. I expected something way better from a 130$ product. To compare, i currently use the 70$ Linsoul kz zs10 pro and the audio quality is 10x better.",1,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Canada
R23WKLDRD6TVFO,Clean sound,Comfortable and well sounding IEMs.,5,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Spain
R1KK9HT56LQ2DP,Great Value,"Good accurate sound, sounds great without DAC.",5,B0BRPR38JR,2024,the United States
RRUVBPKONRI7D,Excelent quality and neutral EIM (for singers),"Had tested a couple of ear buds for my IEM (PSM300), Shure SE215, KZ (don't quite remember the model) IE100 and those IE200.
Quality wize, they are well built, well balanced and more confortable than any other I tested. The small form really helps keeping them confortable!
They're is a small trick you must do to make them optimal (blocking the small hole for the bass release) and they are better with foam tip but when you do, the quality is excellent!

They seems to be less powerful than other models though. but for the price, they are excellent!
And since they use the same model as the more expensive, you get really good bang for your buck!",5,B0BRPR38JR,2024,Canada
R2XZUBY4LOP24B,"Great sound, controls, with one small lroblem","I use these with my iPhones and laptop, and they are great for sound, listening to music, conferencing and more. I love everything about the device including the fit. I have one smaller ear canal than the other so traditional earbuds often had one fall out during activity; not with these. They also offer different sizes right out of the box that I have yet to open.

So I gave the product 5 stars. But the app needs some work. Explanation below with images.

Pros:
Stylish - barely noticeable
Cost considering ANC alternatives
Good controls built into app or earbuds
App structure is clear and Robust and allow additional sound customizations for afficianados.

Cons:
Controls via multiple phones.

I imagine most people are not in my situation but I have two iPhones. The app works great but there’s two small issues:

1. If you pair it with multiple, only one iPhone can control it. You need to know the last one that “connected” to it. You can pair with any device and download app to control on all, but only one app is “connected.” It’s a minor inconvenience.

2. You cannot label the iPhone pairing. The app allows you to toggle which device is using it. For me, this is laptop, iPhone and iPhone. Since you cannot change the label, I have to guess which iPhone I’m turning it on for, haha.

Images: second iPhone just stays at connecting. I haven’t had the patience to see if there’s a timeout. Either phone can connect but if the app is running in the background of one, the other won’t. I have to shut down the app on my first phone for my second to connect.

Second image is the device selection.

I’m not certain if it’s feasible to allow both to control it or if it was a developers choice to simplify potential complications. But being able to label your devices should easily be available.

Finally, I am not sure if my device control issue applies to android/other phones or if it’s iPhone specific.",5,B09BXPKY2Y,2022,Singapore
R5Q9DMJ80SM36,Great value!,"Have a pair of Sennheiser headphones for years so I trusted the brand. Not disappointed, got these for cross Atlantic trip and they were just fine.",5,B09BXPKY2Y,2024,the United States
R1SXC8838YA7WY,They don't last long for what they cost,"This is the second set of sennheiser wireless earbuds I have purchased. The first set were the cx true wireless, they lasted 2 years and both earbuds just stopped working, I could hear very faint clicking noises when trying to play any media. I thought I would upgrade to the next step up with the cx plus wireless, and now after 4 months the right earbud has stopped working with the same problem as the first set of earbuds.
Sennheiser had what I feel Is good sound quality for the price, but for the overall quality of the product, they are terrible, don't waste your money",1,B09BXPKY2Y,2024,the United States
R251XQRKFUCMYB,Awesome!,These earbuds are awesome - they come with different size bud covers and the smallest set is perfect for my ears - they do not hurt like AirPods! And they stay connected as I roam about my house away from my phone. Read the manual about the controls or you’ll drive yourself crazy when you touch them.,5,B09BXPKY2Y,2024,the United States
R3BU1CPF7K4Z0E,Stopped working after 2 months :(,"The right headphone no longer charges or powers on, and the lefts connectivity is spotty because of it. I take good care of them and these are not cheap. I liked them a lot but you only have a month to return so I guess I'm sol",1,B09BXPKY2Y,2024,the United States
R2Z30RMXU9A2U8,Buds case came with scratches,"The buds are in good condition and working fine. It is just the case came with scratches. Therefore, I had to give the amazon quality assurance teams a one star.",1,B09BXPKY2Y,2024,the United States
R10AB1ZN13VPB1,"Product not stable, broken after only 2 months of usage, customer service does not even reply","The one on the left side constantly got disconnected and I have to put it back onto the case to turn it on. The products do not disconnect from phones upon being put back into the case, have to manually disconnect bluetooth, cannot connect for call usage",1,B08ZR5JB9G,2023,Singapore
R1S0RBW2XWLFB8,Great sound but lasts like an open bag of chips,"I bought this in May this year and one side failed 3 months later, got it exchanged for a new one and one side has failed again. It’s consistent, I can give it that. For a big brand it is beyond belief. Yes, Sennheiser has delivered on their famed sound but it seems this product couldn’t last beyond 6 months. I have been using some cheap China earbuds for years, poor sound quality but hey it’s still going and I’m using them now that these CX have failed yet again. I’ve booked an appointment with Sennheiser (available slot a month from now, sigh) and I’m not going to ask for a replacement. I want my money back. Google this issue and it’s all over the net, shame on you Sennheiser.",1,B08ZR5JB9G,2023,Singapore
R3FQSGEH6GFFEG,Great sound quality but requires equalisation.,"Stock out of the box sound is a typical, slightly veiled, warm Sennheiser sound but with a touch more bass. After updating the firmware from the Sennheiser app, use the ""sound check"" function to create your preferred sound using your favourite music playing. For me, the sound check equalisation pushed treble up about 3db and cut bass at about 2db. The earphones now become much clearer, cleans up the sound and bass less boomy. I do enjoy fidelity of the sound, the drivers can handle bass very well, with podcast EQ selected, voices become very natural and easy to listen to for your Spotify podcasts and YouTube lectures.

Fit is a little large and you need get used to it. Stock eartips are a little stiff, and needs time to soften up. Stock eartips are half dome and inserts deep. So no worries about it popping out while doing cardio.

Will recommend if you're willing to EQ the earphones.",5,B08ZR5JB9G,2023,Singapore
R36PUHAVCB9V06,True audio less earbuds,"Bought the Earbuds because of Brand name Sennheiser, Arrived in a day after order, but totally disappointed. At first try the Right ear buds didn't work (No audio, no led), thought might need to charge and charged till green led glowed. Tried earbuds again. Unlucky, the right earbuds was dead always, no audio no light (LED). Is there a quality check of products done by Sennheiser ?
Returning the item back. I guess we need to be lucky to get a working product ?.",1,B08ZR5JB9G,2023,Singapore
R1AACVX1TBESPZ,Left bud not working at all,Bought the earbuds today from Amazon. The left earbud doesn’t charge at all. Not showing any lights. Right one is good. Tried everything. Really bad experience.,1,B08ZR5JB9G,2023,Singapore
R24CWDGY4GJ0X2,Fast delivery and quality product,Ordered on Wed evening and received on Fri afternoon. Sennheiser's quality has never fail to amaze. One of the bang for buck product out there.,5,B08ZR5JB9G,2022,Singapore
R1FXBCYY40IZN1,Great sounding and great value.,Sounds fine. The plastic eartip is a bit odd in ear.,5,B08ZR5JB9G,2021,Singapore
R2J9I8EB6XCGXV,"Unreliable, 10 months only lifetime","Disappointed in the brand. One earbud died after ~10 months from purchase. I was sent a replacement. Interestingly enough same side (left) earbud stopped functioning after 10 months. Another replacement sent (great customer service admittedly). After 11 months, right earbud ceased functioning. Avoid if possible",1,B08ZR5JB9G,2024,the United States
R2WT58RNLXS271,Left unit not working after 4 months of usafe,The quality of version 3 is better than older version but left side unit failed to work after 4 months of usage.  This is very bad!,1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
R2PLZQX0FWWD3R,So far so good,"These Sennheiser MTW3 earbuds sounds so much better than my ipods pro 2. Love it!

Much better than Bose QC2 which i also had. The Bose had terrible connectivity issues with iPhone. So annoyed with the frequent disconnection with the Bose QC2 that i replace with these Sennheisers MTW3. I never had problems with the BT connectivity with MTW3.

Only thing with MTW3 is the bulky charging case as compared to ipod pros.",5,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
R3DARM4WVBXJ8E,Poor Sennheiser after sales support!,"I was happy and very satisfied with the excellent sound quality and feature of this product. Unfortuately, after 2 months of very light use, one of the earbuds would not charge and could not be used.
Have requested for warranty replacement support from Senheisser Singapore through the website. Initially got a response after 1 days and was told to setup RMA for a return via postage to the local support centre. I have used Singpost tracking service which indicated that the product is delivered successfully to the service centre.
From then on, i did not hear from Senheisser on the status of the replacement. It has been 2 months on and after making service email requests and phone calls for status updates, I got none. As I am writing this review, I am on the phone with Senheisser waiting for the other side to pick up the call, which I am waiting for more than 30 minutes. I am not sure if my call would be answered. I have a feeling it would be a total loss on this purchase plus the efforts to return the faulty product and contact I have made with Senheisser would cone to nothing. It is a scam for my experience dealing with the company.
With great disappointment, I would not get another Senheisser product. Although the sound quality is great, the reliability is poor and very expensive.
Buyers of the brand beware!",1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
RXTR8S3MXU0G9,Worked for only 5 months,Worked well for 5 months.  Then left ear bud stopped working and a day later was not able to charge.  Don't waste your money on this product.,1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
RJT4MEEWOFLAT,Worst product to buy,One ear piece has stopped working within a year. Hardly used the product once a month and was not comfortable to use as well. Application had tons of bugs and very hard to switch between multiple devices. Truly disappointed with the product,1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
R1M7SBNKHDSY2Y,Only lasted 5 months,"My right earbud died after 5 months of usage. Earliest Appointment with the service centre was in a month time and  due to replacement stock shortage, my replacement earbuds will take another month to arrive. A total 2 months of waiting before I can get to use my earbuds again. Service centre personnel redirected me to an email address when i ask for a warranty extension of 2 months due to non usage. It has been 2 weeks and i have yet to get a reply or an acknowledgment sennheiser regarding my request. I figured this is going to be my first and last sennheiser product.",1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
R16KT4VNOS0OX2,"Nice sound, but died early as other reviewers said","Bought these in June but one side died on me about four months later -- couldn't charge, couldn't pair, couldn't do anything. When I tried to book an appointment with the warranty dealer, earliest available slot was about 2 months later.

It had great sound while it lasted. But for four months worth of use, I would buy something else.",2,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
RZ1DZBQ79SUBB,Good product. Until it died,"Used with no issues for ~3-4 months. Then the right bud stopped charging and became undetectable

Sent for servicing/ getting free replacement (in another colour because the one i had is out of stock)

Seems to be a fairly common issue from reading comments retrospectively; would consider an alternate product if i had found how unreliable it was",2,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore
R2VKOB8MAQ19RL,Right earbud dead after 5 months.,No way of contacting customer support. Horrible brand and would think thrice before buying from Sennheiser again. Totally waste of time and money,1,B09T935X38,2024,Singapore

R1GPHSYMWQAKCI,Good but not good enough,"They have good sound and connectivity but for a headphone advertised for listening to while being active, they fall short. Compared to my old bose sports earbuds these Sennheiser's are disappointing. I have to readjust them multiple times throughout my workouts and they're really not that comfortable. Just not worth it for $100.",3,B09V1QX6PB,2024,the United States
R13B68DA4P453R,"Want to love these, but they hurt my ears","I have a really hard time finding ear buds that stay in my ears, so I thought I would give these a try. The good news is they definitely stay in my ears, the bad news is they hurt after a while. I love my other Sennheiser headphones and these definitely sound great, but after about an hour on the plane they were really starting to hurt my ears, even with the smallest buds on. It's not bad enough to get rid of them, it's tolerable, but I will likely keep bringing my big headphones for long trips.",3,B09V1QX6PB,2024,the United States
R2DPF6WXWHYRMG,They fit and they stay in my ears.,"Pro:
I have had many earbuds and have always had trouble keeping them in my ears.
I ride a motorcycle so this can be very disconcerting.
These stay in! No slipping. Never fall out.

Con:
They are very sensitive to touch. Easy to alter volume or track inadvertently.",5,B09V1QX6PB,2024,Canada
R2TDEN0GIQDLQZ,"After 1 year of usage, these are approved!","Battery is great.
Sound quality is better than I expected. The Bass is deep, but not muddy.
Lightweight, and my ears don't itch after 4-6 hours. I could do backflips without them falling out.

Only downside I can think of is the touch controls are a little sensitive on the left earbud, and I sometimes pause my podcast or music by accident. It's a minor inconvenience, but it is something I noticed. Maybe there could be a user defined delay so the user has to press for 500ms or something? I should reload the Sennheiser app on the phone and see if its possible.",5,B09V1QX6PB,2024,the United States

R1YPDKRYSYGTI9,Average headphone,"It works, an average headphone not outstanding",3,B07N1YLC23,2020,Singapore
R290XVLQ30BAWB,Crisp and clear,"Great for conference calls. Noise cancellation is great, so I usually put on one side of the ear, in order that I can hear myself talk with the other. When not on calls, the noise cancellation on both ears with the music of your choice does provide good focus.

With regards to listening to music, it does have a good bass, but at default (without any form of settings from your computer), it's great listening for vocals such as Adele and classical pieces.

The ear piece fits comfortably, make is great and looks good too. It fits my needs overall, so giving 5 stars.",5,B07N1YLC23,2020,Singapore
R2ES3QZXVGCDR7,Still works,"After God knows how long ago I purchased this... it still hasnt broken. It was good for its price, its always been with me on my journeys to work.

R2WOIQGJJR14JP,Mixed feelings,"While the fit and sound are great the heart rate monitor gives me much higher values than my watch (Garmin Epix Pro) my heart rate while running is usually 135 the earbuds gave me 178 even though it was an easy run, I unpaired it as a heart rate monitor from the watch.",3,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States
R22YJKSMIXMTA0,"Great sound, unreliable everything else","Sounds is on point and it's mic works great for calls, which is the important things, but the other features are very unreliable ie the heart rate monitor and temperature monitor that may work properly 1 complete work out per week. In other words I've worn them to the gym 3-4 times a week for the passed 3 weeks and I've only received 1 passable workout monitoring, while my Samsung active watch 3 outshines it by far and it's 4 years old....
Also, it may have the worst case for buds I've ever seen, it's big, bulky and not reliable to stay closed. Also, there no external hard covers for it yet",3,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States
RLWQTTFTAMYXK,Great (expensive) Sport Earbuds with some quirks but worth it for the right reasons,"Let me start out by saying that while other reviews say the ANC isn’t that good I really disagree. I’m not sure if they know this but these are semi-open by design and even still the ANC is really good. The reason they are semi-open is beacuse of safety and also beacuse it stops the dreaded foot drop effect when running. You know when you run and you hear each and every step as a thud in your ears? Well these have very little of that. If you’re a runner you know what I speak of.

The default sound profile is good but if you don’t like it you can tune the buds to your liking in the sennheiser app. The app isn’t the best but it’s much better than allot of the competition out there.

I use these with an Apple device so I don’t get to take advantage of the aptX codec but even with AAC it does sound really good.

The anti-wind mode is really awesome for outdoor runs. It does a fantastic job at cancelling out wind noise. I honestly don’t even hear it when in this mode. I’d say transparency mode is about 80% of what Apple AirPods Pro 2 are. It’s very solid.

My two biggest knocks on them are that the fins aren’t very comfortable and I think the heart rate and temp sensors are gimicky (I am not in the Polar ecosystem).

After about an hour or use. There is some dull feeling in my ears and I use the smallest fins. Unlike the Beats sport buds which are one solid piece of rubber fin they put a slit in the fin which I think is for flexibility. What ends up happening is that they dig into your ears a bit. I hope they or someone makes after market fins that are a little more comfortable.

Secondly, I have an Apple Watch Ultra and get my heart rate from it as connect it to my watch for music on my runs. I’m not sure if these will ever integrate into Apple health but the polar app really isn’t all that useful for someone not using a polar device. I use these mostly for running and I don’t see the value in the polar integration since I’m not in that ecosystem.

If sennheiser were to fix the fins and make them a solid piece of rubber and possibly removed the heart rate and temp sensors and sold the buds for ~$60 less these would be the the most recommended sport buds. However with the beats sport buds a bit less you really have to see the value in the sound quality to get these.

All in all as an audio enthusiast and outdoor fitness person I will highly recommend these. I think the sound quality and ability to customize the EQ is a great feature. The ANC, transparency, and anti-wind modes all deliver, and while I don’t find the find comfortable they buds always feel secure in my ears and I never worry about them falling out.",4,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States
R12ORL2LZERZB0,Good for sport but.....,"I am a fan of Sennheiser's line of headphones (Sennheiser Momentum 1, 2 & 3). I use them for weightlifting; they don't budge from your ears at all. They have a very fast connection to the phone or a second device like a PC at the same time. The sound quality is good, but compared to other Sennheiser models like the Momentum 3 I have, the quality doesn't measure up, nor does the volume, which is a bit lower. If you're in the gym with very loud background music, the noise cancellation might not be very effective (they are similar to open-back headphones). The problem starts when you're a very active runner and tend to sweat a lot; since they use silicone tips and your ears get moist, they tend to fall out even when using the provided ear fins. I have used the heart rate sensor and it is not as accurate as a watch (Samsung Watch 6). If I'm going for a run longer than 3 miles, I don't use them because they end up falling out of my ears. I give them 3 stars; I expected them to be a bit better given their high price.",3,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States
R1EN3RIK6O6O54,One major irate.,"Would be a great product except for the removable/adjustable rubber ear clips. There a pain to get on and adjust properly and then they move out of adjustment easily. They also prevent the buds from seating properly in the case causing charging problems if out of adjustment.
Ended using without the clips.
Still use my 3 yr old Bose buds more than these.",3,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States
RBMIYR6TE8W5I,Not great. Borderline terrible.,"Honestly I am shocked at just how bad these units are, especially for the price, and especially when compared to Sennheiser's own Momentum TWS 4, which costs $30 less:
- They sound worse, with even less treble extension and with less detail overall.
- The noise canceling is worse, the isolation is worse, and the max volume is, AT MOST, 75% of the Momentum TWS 4. Despite being a fitness product, these are much more difficult to hear in loud environments.
- Again, despite being a fitness product, these actually fit less snugly and are objectively less comfortable. Where the Momentum TWS 4 is very smooth and contoured, with no sharp edges to be found, these are instead slightly textured. Now that alone wouldn't be an issue and probably does help with breathability, but bizarrely the texture doesn't smooth out on the edges around the sensor or stabilization fins, meaning these are effectively covered in small serrated edges that are very noticeable against your skin.
- The near-tap gestures are a neat idea, but are just not implemented well. The only other device I've seen this in is the original Sony Link Buds, where it worked absolutely flawlessly with even light taps up to ~2 inches in front of your ear. Unfortunately even at high sensitivity these barely work with uncomfortably firm taps and require you to be so close that you might as well just be tapping the buds directly.
- The case is very large and has a lid that is held on solely with magnets and a thin silicone hinge, which is nowhere near strong enough to justify including a lanyard loop.
- The eartips are made of a very stiff and almost plastic-feeling material that is far less grippy than the Momentum TWS 4. It is also translucent to allow for the fitness sensors, which means you can't use aftermarket tips if you want the sensors to function properly.

Overall these are just not a good product, and honestly seem like something that they ended up sinking too much money into to justify scrapping.",2,B0CXFDRFTL,2024,the United States

The Sports sound better than my Bose and have more clarity, but they are behind in ANC. However, being sports headphones ANC is not as important to me. Sennheiser's buds get significantly louder than my Bose (100 decibels), capping over 105 decibels using Apple Music. Overall, these are excellent headphones, but overpriced due to the unnecessary health-tracking features. I say unnecessary because having a smartwatch makes HR and body temp tracking redundant.

R2WPMDIHRN0ZE5,Amazing sound,"I recently ordered the Sennheiser Accentum True Wireless Earbuds, and I had a bit of a rocky start. The first pair I received were defective—they sounded terrible and had no bass at all. Fortunately, the replacement pair I got were absolutely amazing.

The sound quality is crystal clear with a lesser focus on deep bass but incredible minds and highs. The ANC isn't anywhere near as good as other earbuds at this price, unfortunately. The ergonomic design makes them comfortable for long listening sessions, and the 28-hour battery life is impressive.

The app that comes with these earbuds is the best I’ve ever used. It’s intuitive and offers a lot of customization options, enhancing the overall experience.

RHSE5ZNUK737W,Doesn't hold a charge,"The acoustics are laudable. It is balanced and the details are lovely. Unfortunate the device is marred by being too clever for its own good. Understandably the airpods have provided the premium brands to catch up to at least a suite of features that is necessary for a given price point. I'm speaking specifically about the proximity sensor where the earbud leaves the ear or approaches and it switches itself on our suspends is function. This proved to be it's downfall for me anyway, I don't like to leave a battery charge midway or one that doesn't require a full charge to be placed in the battery case. But the proximity sensor switches itself on when toggled or moved about in any way. It's exacerbated as are no physical buttons and it's extremely frustrating because the battery leaks heavily when automatically connects. I had a full charge then separated the case from the buds and left it on a pouch. 2 days later the battery was down 80% and I didn't use it just was traveling in my bag. For battery conservationist like me especially for premium priced products. You want to prolong the life and one of the details you want to preserve is undoubtedly the battery life span. I have had the same nasty issue with Sony Wf-1000xm4. There is no way to disable the sensor. I returned them and have gone back to my anker.

R38MYR0EWK91W0,More cons than pros — Decent backup pair,"I’ll keep this to the point for TLDR buyers.

PROS:
- Battery life is FANTASTIC. 10+ hours of listening.
- Connectivity is great. Bluetooth doesn’t have to search and pairs very quickly. Never disconnects.
- Range is pretty good too. I can get quite a ways away from my device, and it still plays.
- Sound quality is above average, but not amazing. More expensive earbuds are way better, but I am fine with the lows and the highs.

CONS (**UPDATED)
- **I rarely use headphones for phone calls. I tried this on a Zoom, and the mic is horrible. Changing my rating.
- Not the best fit. Even with the largest ear tips, they don’t stay in snuggly. Hard to put in and take out as well. Just doesn’t seem to mold to your ear.
- The battery (though great) is located in the center of the wire intended to rest on your neck. But it feels heavy, flops around and is a very imbalanced design.
- No shirt clip included, but there isn’t a practical spot for a clip anyways if you have an extra.
- The control buttons and their indentions are not pronounced enough, and I find it difficult to execute basic functions blindly.
- The power button must be held for five seconds to turn on or off. I don’t know why but I find this  obnoxious. Especially when you can’t feel which button is the power button without looking.
- It does not inform you of the battery life when you turn on.
- I suppose it’s for water/sweat proofing, but the battery flap is really freaking hard to open.
- TONS of vibration noise when items rub against any part of it. Obviously, some noise is to be expected, but even simply walking with a jacket on rubbing the wires can overpower your listening.",2,B083W8TM8V,2024,the United States

The touch-control system on these is absolutely diabolical. If I want to change song/pause/answer a call I need to press the button like 6 times for my finger to land on it just right. Sometimes I get lucky and it goes first try, most times it takes multiple taps. Absolutely forget about it if you're doing any sort of exercise and your fingers have a smidge of sweat on them. All of this DRIVES ME NUTS.

Comically, if you take them out to talk to someone (say, while at the gym) and hold them in your hand, you'll return the buds to your ears only to find that you've skipped like 16 songs ahead. So exactly when you don't want the touch-control to work, it has unbelievable accuracy. This also drives me nuts.

You are able to reprogram the controls, meaning you can change which taps do what, so maybe you want pause to be one right tap, or two right taps. You can do that. But this doesn't change the fact that actually landing a successful tap on your first try is almost impossible. Terrible user experience.

The cable is too thin. Will likely break later. The two modules will hit you on the neck. It is not that uncomfortable, but it is not great. I can live with it because of the great sound quality but they should have used a design like the OnePlus Bullets 2 where the cable around the neck is bulkier the weight rests there instead of the two modules between the ears and the neck on each side.

R22L7LFZPWYJ3T,Quality Control Lacking,"After lots of comparison shopping/online reviews, I opted for these Sennheiser Consumer Audio IE 80 S Adjustable Bass earbuds.  Being thrifty, I purchased a used set at reduced pricing based on Amazon's statements about how such products are reviewed & tested, etc. Well, someone missed the boat on this set. They came to me in the original (now all beat up) box with the back partially torn off and ""UNSEALED.""  The previous owner had twisted and wrapped the wiring tightly resulting in the entire length of wiring permanently twisted.  It's a hassle trying to lay it out each time I use it. The plug jammed first time I attempted to insert it into my Bose volume control.  Then sound cut out in one ear.  But, I reinserted the plug several times and that seems to have cleared up. The previous owner's ear cups were still on the earbuds and apparently had NOT been cleaned!  Otherwise, the box did contain all the parts EXCEPT the tool to adjust the bass.  I don't mind being thrifty, but there was an apparent lack of quality control and inventory with this purchase.",3,B0765RF78D,2024,the United States

The bass is mid, the treble is just banged up, and feels more like noise. Nothing is clear. JFC Sennheiser sucks.

R3L222JXVKZP6N,Very disappointed with Sennheiser,"Packaging/Presentation 5/5 - well packaged, comes in a case, presentation is nice.
Build Quality 4/5 - plastic, not the best material
Sound Quality 2/5 - average bass, everything else is subpar, leading to a hollow/cheap sounding earphones.
Comfort 3/5 - decently comfortable, but did not wear for a long time.
Value 1/5 - These headphones are NOT worth 200$ (249$ originally). Deeply disappointed in Sennheiser -- their headphone products have always been wonderful, but these earphones are at most worth 20$.

This earphone sounds worse than 30$ IEMs(BLON BL03). Definitely would not recommend buying.",2,B0765RF78D,2022,the United States
R28I3MKI9XU2PH,Sennheiser thoughts...,Ambient noise elimination is an issue with these but I am converting from Etymotic inner ear monitors so this may be unfair. I prefer the IEM configuration and the Sennheiser units are overpriced in my opinion. I am a long time Sennheiser user (approx. 40 years) therefore I'm very loyal.

RDA1II0WCKHT4,Amazing IEM,"I am an audiophile and have bought a lot of IEMs including much more expensive ones. I never met an IEM could provide such deep bass and extended highs except IE900. The taste is warm and soundstage is pretty wide. Maybe the performance of Vocals is not as good as other expensive flagship IEMs, but it is much better than the predecessor IE800 and also AKG N5005.
BTW, there are many fake IE900 on the market. I bought this IE900 from a third-party seller named Brandswalk. It is on the list of sennheiser authorized dealer, so I don’t worry about any possible counterfeit products.",5,B094DP3177,2024,the United States
RFEGFUUEFWX87,Overpriced...,"I was a big fan of the IE300, but mine died due to output impedance on the audio interface I was using at the time. I got rid of that thing and now decided that it was a good excuse to upgrade the IEMs I was using, so I pulled the trigger on these and long story short, I sent them back. They are THE most comfortable IEMS that one can buy, but the sound quality and tuning choices they made on this IEM are just puzzling, and the build quality leaves a bit to be desired. At the end of the day, are they bad? No. Definitely not. Are they worth a kilobuck and then some? Definitely not. If these were in the $500-$1000 range, they'd be in my ears right now, but they're just overpriced for what they are.

For those interested in this, just save some money and get the IER-M9. Insanely better tuning, higher quality, a little bit less comfortable, but still pretty good, and its right at $1000.",3,B094DP3177,2024,the United States

R1S6MC7KJNJ9AU,got my hopes up,"I just knew with a name like Sennheiser, some good reviews, and a moderate price that I would  be able to use these in-ears successfully with my existing monitor tx/rx system.  I already knew my system was great with my mid-level AKG headphones, but don't want to wear full headphones all night onstage.  I carefully unpacked these buds and hooked them up just like I had the 'phones, and the sound was atrocious.  Full fuzz on the low notes of my guitar, and lack of any definition on the mid and upper registers.  I was prepared with a 10-band equalizer to fix any issues I might have.  After rolling out all the sliders from 31hz to 250hz, the fuzz was gone but I couldn't get any definition throughout the spectrum no matter what.  I finally came up with a compromise for the guitar and checked my Shure SM57 mic.  It sounded very much like a toy mic that would be included with a child's first karaoke set.  I never succeeded in getting the mic to sound passable, and anything I adjusted destroyed the flimsy compromise I had made for the guitar sound.  I guess I will use my in-ear system (with headphones) for rehearsal at home and continue to use floor wedges for live work.  These are going back to the seller.",1,B08TCJZBK8,2024,the United States

R359PTTOOZHEMQ,Wonder why they are sold out.,"After returning the first one with Amazon.com as seller (it was used, missing pouch and cables were not tied neatly).  I got the second pair from a seller called LiquidAudio.  This time the package was pristine and everything inside was perfect.

I replaced the cable with one from okcsc that has a 4.4mm jack and the tips with a pair of SpinFit W1.  All I can say is WOW, compared to my former Audio Technica ATH-IM70 is night and day.  The sound of all the True Wireless I have (Anker, JLab, Edifier, Beats Fit Pro,KST), are not even close. The details I can hear with the IE100 Pro are amazing.

Using it with a WIndows 11 desktop connected to a Fiio KA5 dongle, must lower the volume to 25 to 30 as these are loud. Volume is much more controlled when I use it with the FIIO Q3-MQA connected to my Sony Walkman.

R2BK2J64AXIH1G,"Balanced and neutral sound, perfect choice ","I liked the vocal tone it produces, also, I would like to mention, I know as entry level IEMs, there are options available from KZ audio, 7Hz etc. but in my opinion, it’s worth spending more and getting the Sennheiser’s, especially if you are vocalist, keyboardist or guitarist, basically for melody section… People say they didn’t feel much bass, but for me, the lower end punch is just adequate, not like any bass boosted cheap earphones… Fit was also good, gets locked perfectly into the ear, might be discomforting for some people after a long usage, but that’s the case with most of the IEMs, so no complaints for it from my side at least, stereo imaging is just great!",5,B08TCJZBK8,2023,India
R1E8OAKS5A1P6W,Impressive,"I’m kind of novice with pro-audio. I play guitar and sometimes it’s very difficult to hear my guitar while I’m singing and when everybody is singing.

Someone told me about in-ears and I was like “what’s so special about it…. I can just use my beats headphones to the mixer.” After researching, it looks like in-ears are more of like a high quality sound for you to listen while performing live without needed to crank up the volume which can damage your ears.

After trying this in-ear monitor I was very impressed! I thought it was just a gimmick that these companies are saying about sound quality. The sound quality is very real. It can also block some of the outside noise but I’m not so sure if that’s active noise cancelling or if it’s just the mechanism of an in-ear device. Regarding fit, for some reason my right ear is bigger than my left so I just needed to swap a bigger one for my right. I’m not sure if that’s recommended tho. Anyways, I am very impressed. I think the value is really good for the quality.",5,B08TCJZBK8,2023,the United States

The sound is so crummy compared to all their other stuff, I know it's Bluetooth but I've never heard the quality be that junky before. Maybe these are good enough to tell me that the music sucks, idk but hard pass and I paid 112 for them. I'm returning them and I paid, I repeat, 112 dollars, not 450.

R3FZLBX3DOJ6OL,My all-time favorite headphones ... until they inevitably stop working,"For some initial context: I've now owned three pairs of these headphones.

I greatly enjoy using these headphones day-to-day. The sound quality is excellent, they're very comfortable and I have no worries about losing them while biking or walking about. As a rule, I *greatly* prefer this around-the-neck/over-the-ear style of headphone as opposed to ear buds.

There are some definite downsides, though. I have not benchmarked this but the battery probably doesn't last more than four or five hours. Also, a more concerning issue is that the headphones inexplicably begin to fail after about one year. The symptom is always the same: the left speaker gradually gets quieter until you can't hear any sound coming out of it. I often wear only the left headphone (something you can't do with ear buds ...) while I'm cooking, doing yard work, grocery shopping and perhaps this causes it to wear out faster? I also wear them while exercising and it's possible that sweat is causing accelerated deterioration. Regardless, this has happened to all three of the sets I've purchased. Thankfully, Sennheiser makes good on their warranty and replaces them promptly and without any undue stress. Unfortunately, they replace them with Momentum 2/3 ear buds. I wish they would repair them -- I'd even pay them to but they seem to have moved on.

So, as long as you understand the stakes, I would still recommend buying them. I use them every single day and don't feel slighted -- especially at the currently discounted price. I'm writing this review as I mentally prepare to buy my fourth pair. This is admittedly absurd but I can't stand ear buds and I'm not aware of any other similarly styled headphones on the market which sound or feel as good.",3,B07WWKH1B7,2023,the United States

(Also will feel a larger EMF tingle and plastic detox 100%, but will need to go to 70$ JBL Outside Ears for that  anyway or the comparable 15$ mono prices, the Grado 125 to 250's otherwise the highest we recommend you need to go to for top AQ, won't get it either and you'll feel a slight EMF circle your head!)  So keep that in mind on any future purcheses or any bigger magnet IEM's need a amp as well!  I just tried the new sport sandisk and the stock buds got it on bass and detail and I'd say worth the 50$, just on the buds and all anyone needs, but couldn't drive these Senns for any bass.  The current best DAP to enjoy these on and hit the IPOD Gen 5.5 Classic or up, but has sound cards up to 256Gb a lot want and for Windows Wav files is the 110$, HI FI WALKER H2  (Used to be a Figi but they only sell super high rez, super expensive stuff now.)  Well and not happy with your current cell or such.  Get's the same 4 star rating versus the high rez 5 ones!  (And drives up to 150 ohm phones!)  But no FM like a cell or the Sandisk.  So these Senns don't get me top Bench Reference, but I'll be more than happy with indefinetly!  (I have smaller ears and the Focals are just a tad un-comfy for past a couple hours for me, but I'll love better on just those 2 albums so far.)  But will only care for that much added definition when back on the stereo and 5"" moniters or the Focal 65 WPC, AQL4, 1 -6 1/2""s.  So I'd say go for it, unless a *High Rez Nurd and the expensive limited album list, The *Spoiled Rotten 5'er Gang enjoys!
  Full horns and electric guitar is achieved at 33wpc AQL2 on Focal 1 -61/2"" in a AQ thick 1 1/2"" cabinets.  (Especially on the Baffle is most noticable for another added x2 Bass, Volume, Detail.)  Versus only JBL sells kit speakers with the longer, double wrapped coil are a x2 Bass, Volume Detail than your cheap Pionear or Infinities, have a short coil.  (And all *Most care about!)  The ones went with the 3 way, AQL5 120wpc systems, all said there's not enough music there to be worth it.  And only go past AQL3 at 50wpc if you want the added volume.  Where Level 4 comes in and you get all the vibrations and under the stage, to can feel a vocalists throat vibrate, is Super, Foot Stomping LIVE!  Though and most exciting like your really there!  (Most like it mellower!)  I liked about 30% vibration and not so obnoxious with the heavy vibes slamming your chest!  @ 55 -58wpc on the 6 1'2"" Focals, (DC volt read 65 -68 on a powerbanked, hopped up amp, but just is extra fluff at that reading.)  But want to really crank it was NOT enough Volume and Bass for me, when I blew that amp.  So I'd personally like at least 65 -70wpc and recomend that the limit for no noise complaints your gonna get at 100 to 190 for sure!  A good 50wpc is loud enough for a party and cranks, but a mellow amp more and is NOT neighborhood bothering on late night.  Otherwise I wish all reviews would mention the exact size bass anything has and I can always tell a 5-15"" exactly!  *Got enough Bass, doesn't get it!  Then the other half always says, *Not enough bass.  Well does it even get the Double Bass fully on jazz?  (A AQ Focal 6 1/2"" equals a typical 8"".)  Otherwise, get's the Double Bass, get's it!  (Most like a lighter 6 1/2"" mid-bass and most all the ladys and me too.)  Mr. Focal says the 6 1'2"" gets Acoustic Guitar Bass perfect, *Live and then you are accenting up the bass from there!  *And most all world run!  And does the big bass guitar plenty on country with Focals anyway and well probably any expensiver US made Loudspeakers like JBL, Vanderstein, PBS ect. ect.  (Focals were made for recording studios and perfect AQL5 and up, JBL's and Vanderstiens will sound just a little softer is all.)  But some don't like as much,  but I'd be happy with except for trying to Record Acoustic at AQL5!  But you have that same best AQ a LOT cheaper with a decent DAP and buds!  And these are the one's most all buy to up their I Pods with.  If you lead a symphony and need to review the daily tapes *Live, with that many instruments, you need the Zalytron, Focal Kevlar, 5 -1-5's at 60watts each and the T-90 tweeter and a 120 wpc amp.  (But the only reason to ever go that high and gives just under a 6 1/2"" bass, but you'd add a 15"" push pull sub for total full classical bass theater sound show.)  You'll only get full bass detail with a 80 watt 8"" and no 10"" world can do.  (And most all recommend for any future sub and me too.)  And super exciting on drums!!  (Or ever go a AQL5 3 way.)  Also is wider dispersion for full field and 10"" focused.  The Focal 100 w 10"" is super awesome, exciting on a drum solo, mainly, but just to much, you don't want or need and are for real big rooms to project a longer distance.  (And I was running my 190wpc Focal 1-5-10's and ever go the 70 w, 5"" mids extreme max and I recommend just the standard 50 -60's.) And the 60's for me.  And want the very best *Top World Audiophile Quality possible!  (Or a comparable American made and most make AQ!  And read the reviews.)  Otherwise I might like the Focal 7"" on the next set I build if anything and just a little more bass be nice sometimes and versus a possible 1 -5-8 be way more like it on a lot of big majestic bass, Classical!  _(To those awesome 10"" KEF transmission line towers!)  And ouh!  And ever get way into classical later!!  Most all retired got into AQL4 Classical just went the Vanderstien 1 -6 1/2""s, where they quit trying to sell the 1 -4 -10's.  And have super big bass for that and the 10's were to much for me too.  And the Rotel Planer 2 Table just get's AQL2 *Live!  (And most, most all care to get too.)  And do sound VERY most beautiful, possible on the Tom Scott Sax!  And I'm sure you can enjoy 100% with these buds as well!  *Top Recomended  -*An Average, All American, Audiophile Joe  -2023",5,B00N3RFFZ2,2023,the United States

R1FCRRL0ZHZABK,It's my go-to in restaurants!,"I suffer from garden variety high frequency hearing loss. You know, the frequencies where my wife's and grandchildren's voices. So I've had conventional hearing aids for some time. They work well -- my speech comprehension is noticeably better with them in, and, at a movie theater or concert where the volume of the sound system is too high, they do a god job as sound attenuators when I pull the batteries! Where they don't work well is in restaurants. The background noises and percussives from the kitchen and table settings produce a cacophonous mess. The Conversation Clear Plus provides a reasonable solution to this problem. Sennheiser has balanced noise canceling technology with a selective boost of speech frequencies that makes it possible to carry on a conversation in a fairly noisy restaurant. That's what I hoped they would do, and, for me, they deliver. They're also a darned good set of Bluetooth noise cancelling earbuds too!

Also, I need to watch out when I put them in the charge case.  Sometimes they don't connect with the charging contacts unless I wiggle them a bit.",4,B0BRT2GDTX,2023,the United States
R2JK559CVX3LTY,High Quality,"Just purchased the Conversation Clear Plus wireless earbuds from Sennheiser.  A couple quick tips/suggestions for new users:
1. Be sure to determine which tips and fins best fit your ears before getting started.  Once adjusted, they fit great and were very comfortable and secure in my ears and makes the setup and, of course, user experience much better.
2. Set up and connect via Bluetooth through the App vs. connecting the Bluetooth direct with your phone.  While it may seem like it saves time to connect directly, the app is worth the time to set up for optimal experience and only takes a couple moments.
Otherwise, maybe to state the obvious from a product from Sennheiser, the sound quality is truly exceptional.  The ability to adjust the ambient balancing to one’s surroundings is a unique feature not common across other high quality earbud products.  Further, the speech enhancement feature is a differentiator in delivering crystal clear audio.  Whether streaming or conversing, the sound quality is crystal clear.  Admittedly, this is not a cheap product but worthwhile for anyone who either benefits from the enhanced audio or appreciates the ability to truly customize the audio clarity to one’s personal preferences.",4,B0BRT2GDTX,2023,the United States
RFTACQ0FLB7H4,Easy to Use and Good Sound Enhancement,"Pairing and set-up were easy for Conversation Clear Plus.

The Sonova chip technology is surprisingly good in automatic scene detection to balance speech volume and background noise, with active noise cancellation.  A person speaking, in front of you…their voice is enhanced over surrounding noise.  Works great.

The app design allows great manual control beyond the automatic settings, for external noise, speech volume and a mix of balance while listening to music or audio/video calls; though an improvement for saving a profile would be welcome.

The three sizes of ear tips allowed a good choice for good fit.

After using AirPod Pro lately, these Sennheiser ear buds are a more advanced alternative for growing hearing issues.  Highly recommended.",4,B0BRT2GDTX,2023,the United States
R201VHOFT5T55Q,Very helpful! Highly recommend!,"I have mild hearing loss so I lose details of conversations and have to very often ask people to repeat themselves. Restaurants and parties are especially hard as there is so much ambient noise. A friend suggested that I try these and they have truly made a difference for me. They look a little on the large size but fit well once i changed to the smaller silicone ear tips. They are very comfortable. The conversation clear app was very easy to use, which is a big deal for me since I’m not particularly technically skilled.
Peoples’ voices were much more intelligible. You can tap the earbuds directly to change the volume levels although I find it easier to use the app. The battery life is very good.
I’ve been using them to also listen to music and podcasts and the sound clarity is excellent. I really love the fact that I have top quality earbuds that also serve a dual purpose of making hearing clearer.
This was definitely an investment but one that will really pay off for me!! It has changed the way I interact with people and I am no longer struggling to hear people speak. A true game changer!",5,B0BRT2GDTX,2023,the United States
R3KE26C9LQKEXT,Makes conversations in noisy environments easier,"I went back and forth between a 4 and a 5 star review. This is a brand new technology and product category, so surely, there are a still a few things that can be improved in future generations (see below). But the speech clarity this product brings to noisy environments (e.g. packed restaurants/bars) is very impressive and has been a game-changer, so I ultimately decided to give 5 stars.

+ Speech clarity/boost in noisy environment
+ ANC when streaming is truly impressive
+ Easy to connect to iphone
+ Battery lifetime (insane!)
+ fit was ok

- changing settings / volume / etc. on earbud not super intuitive

R1CWQ0M0U815A7,Should have been good but are not,"I have an old Sennheiser wireless headphone set I use for watching TV. Unfortunately they no longer hold their charge so I decided to buy this Sennheiser earbud set believing in the brand name.
I'm not particularly tech savvy but have been around apps and computers, phones, etc. for a while. I found this set up to be very 'fiddly' and I seriously doubt anyone in their 70's or older will be bothered trying to get them to work. I now have them going but only just. The sound quality is dreadful and the supposed adjustments the multi lingual instructions tell you, don't really work.

RLPK1H9UHP8SS,Wish there was more volume,"This has finally solved the problem of needing not to disturb my elderly father when I want to watch television while he’s resting/asleep but it has limitations. It took me a while to get it set up (despite it being simple in theory), not least because the volume was very low or on silent at first. Exploring the online instruction manual was easier than the printed sheet supplied and then installing the app to my phone so I could adjust speech clarity helped sort that out. However even at maximum the volume is a bit low for me other than when sitting simply watching. If I want to eat or move around much it easily gets swamped, especially if eating something crunchy as that goes through the skull rather than down the ear canal so it requires extra volume not sound cancelling. It’s better with changes to speech clarity settings but not enough and it isn’t always speech you want more of.  As a carer I also can’t go the complete noise cancelling route ( which anyway I don’t find that complete) as I need to be aware if I’m needed. Sound overall (aside from the enhanced speech clarity) isn’t a patch on my technics earbuds but I’d tried a few Bluetooth transmitters before and had significant latency issues. The good news is these have zero latency on my TV. So this is a useful set up but not without issues, especially volume and sound quality so it really depends what you want to achieve. It works for me right now and the buds stay in well thanks to the wings.",4,B09X26KR6G,2024,the United Kingdom
R1F0BG704ZHDMJ,Very disappointed with the intermittent sound drop out.,Even though the earbuds are fully charged the sound from the earbuds cuts out intermittently in either the left or right earbud and at random times cuts out completely in both.  The only way to start them up again is to put them back into the charging box for a short time then they work again until the next time they cut out.  I have tried both the digital and analogue connection to my smart TV and the performance is the same.  Very frustrating.,2,B09X26KR6G,2024,Australia
RC3NVD6AW6YN,Great features regardless of your smartphone,"So, to be transparent the noise cancelling stopped working after 13 months of owning them but I still use them in quiet environments.
I've used the earphones a lot as I travel a fair amount with my job and also when exercising.  They've had a tough life with bouncing around my bag and sweat from running.  The case has remained intact and the buds still look like the day I bought them.
One thing I noticed around month 11 was the battery charge in the case wasn't as good as day 1 and I needed to recharge it more but that's likely due to charging fatigue and it happens for many devices.
The software (App) provides great functions and if you're planning to use these while exercising I'd recommended turning off the touch controls as any minor adjustments I made in my ear it paused or moved tracks.

R12J7RV96HFWTG,Good sound,"I had the other version 'plus' which had the noise canceling feature. My son decided he liked them and I had to order myself some replacements. I didn't pay attention and got these instead of the plus. Having had experience of both, I find that these are not hugely different. It has all the same features and great sound. The only difference I could tell was that if traffic is roaringly buisy you are more aware of it. That said I didn't increase the volume as it was still audible and enjoyable. I also noticed that when someone called my name to get my attention I was vaguely aware of it, whereas the plus version I was oblivious to the point that when they then got fed up and tapped me I would jump out of my skin.

The EQ sound test setting is such a good feature as our hearing changes as we age. When my son tried mine he didn't like how it sounded. When I tried his I couldn't here some of the parts I could here in my own settings such as mid range instruments.

I haven't got them wet and don't intend to but they are said to be splash proof, so I have confidence using them in the gym when I sweat or out in the rain with my coat hood up.

These are very bulky in my small ears. However they stay in place. I was okay with the size buds that were pre installed. The best way to put them in is to insert and twist upwards.

R34VVKKOMFBCJ4,"Disappointing Build Quality, Despite Impressive Sound","I recently purchased the Sennheiser IE 400 Pro, and while I have no complaints about its sound quality, I must express my disappointment with its build quality. Here are my observations:

Sound Quality: The IE 400 Pro delivers an impressive audio experience. The fine trebles and rich sub-bass create an immersive stage sound.

Build Quality Issues: Unfortunately, the build quality falls short. The cable has started flaking off and fraying, which is frustrating. Moreover, obtaining a replacement cable in India is challenging there is none available. Unlike standard MMCX connectors, the IE 400 Pro uses a proprietary cable, limiting our options for replacements.

Longevity Concerns: When I purchased these earphones, I expected them to last. After all, the convenience of not discarding a good set of earphones when the battery dies was a significant selling point. However, the wire didn’t even survive a year before failing.

Warranty Process: I’ve sent the IE 400 Pro for replacement under warranty, but I’m concerned about the long-term situation. If the wire fails again after another year, I’ll be out of warranty and facing the same issue.

Similar Experience with IE 100 Pro: Unfortunately, my experience with the IE 100 Pro has been similar. The wires on that model are also fraying and flaking at the joints.

In summary, while the IE 400 Pro offers excellent sound, the build quality leaves much to be desired. Sennheiser should address these issues to ensure a more durable product for its customers.",1,B07MPS6384,2024,India

R3DSAOTHB1YHZH,It’s the Ear Tip Dude!!,"Many complaints about earbud sound quality are due to poorly chosen OR poorly designed ear tips.  Every ear canal is a little different and getting the fit that fills the ear canal and holds the bud at the right angle can make a HUGE difference in hearing music well across the full human hearing spectrum.

If the canal fit is poor…the sound is often horrible and your money is wasted, because of something you can generally fix.  It’s the Ear Tips Dude!

Higher-end earbuds address the need for a great fit in a variety of tip designs to give the best fit.  Try them out!

I also feel WAY less ""separated"" from the music I'm playing versus my experience with other headphones. Paired with a solid headphone amp, you're going to have an awesome time going back into recordings you've heard before, and finding a whole range of ""space"" to listen to!

RTMFZBG6AGBNA,"Very difficult to get to fit and stay in your ears, which affects the sound quality drastically.","I almost gave up on trying them to fit at all until I tried the large memory foam adapters, which just barely worked and were still too loose and easy to dislodge. When they were seated perfectly, the sound was absolutely incredible for such small drivers. Unfortunately, the wires are too short and very easy to tug them out of proper interface with the ear, which requires you to compress the foam and hold them in place for about a minute (the 15 seconds they recommend is not enough) to get back to listening. It is a shame that the fit is such a problem because they sound amazing when they are fitted properly. From the lowest bass notes to the highest treble frequencies, the details are ridiculous. I am surprised that they can't find a solution to this problem. I have a pair of 10 year old Moto EH25 and they fit perfectly in my ears and I only wish that the IE-800-S had the same kind of of foam. Also, I don't know whose ears are going to work with the silicone tips, but they are not at all useful for me, from the small to the largest, they just don't make a good seal.

Transparent, detailed and neutral (reduced U-shape voicing compared with the original IE800), with fine focus and detailed staging. Also built well, with excellent ergonomics. As for VFM, it depends... full RRP is £800, which is steep. I bought them from Amazon at just over £500, however, which is excellent; no earbud in this price range can be said to be cheap, but £500 is good value for what these earbuds offer.

Now for some points to note:

1) Like any electromechanical transducer, these require a few hundred hours of run-in before sounding at their best.

2) Really only appropriate for high-res sources; for MP3 or CD Res, you will not hear what these devices are truly capable of. Get something cheap and nasty to match source quality...

3) These could not be called raunchy, exaggerated or rock-oriented; but they are great for acoustic jazz or classical. Suits me!

4) Purist, with emphasis on SQ. So no electronic noise cancellation; needless to say, the digital-domain processing this requires screws with SQ, big-time.

R1CP86CALZJNSH,Imagine sound in a death grip...,"There I was lamenting the loss of my older cheap-o headphones that had served me well, but had been poorly engineered.  Should I replace them with another pair of the same company?  And what, reward those fools with more money for poor engineering?  I think not.

Then low and behold I found these bad boys...the ""Sennheiser PMX 684i Fitness"" headphones.  Okay, let's get something straight, if you are working out with wired headphones in this day and age, you aren't working out much but you are living under a rock, and unless I'm mistaken, there isn't much movement room under rocks for workouts.  But they had the similar design for what I'm looking for: single wire from the headphones, wire from one ear piece, better sound (I mean these are Seenheiser's right?), but of course a bit more significant on the price.  I took the bait.  My hard earned lettuce tossed immediately with the reward of capitalism.  I bought some.

And hey, many of those things were met.  The were light weight and low profile, they had much better bass response than my older cheapo headphones, and the wire was in a much better place allowing ease to slip on.  But then the demon came out of them and I was instantly in a vice grip  of death!  OMG! The pain!  Having these headphones crushing my skull trying their best to pierce them through my ears!  I wanted to rip them off my head for freedom, but the sounds were sweet...it was as if they whispered deep in my soul.  ""You can't be rid of me...you like the sound of my voice in your head!""  It was a spell!  They lied to me with their cheap cushions that attempted to fit over the ear pieces, but they shed those soon enough somewhere, probably to be sucked up by the vacuum cleaner or similar.  Now just the pure plastic to stab in me.  I swear there are sores in my ears now from the death grip.

The bottom line, unless you are into pain or are into trading somewhat decent sound for pain, you should probably steer clear of these.  These would only be sufficient for workouts in the dungeon.  If you order these, make sure to celebrate the freedom while you had it.",3,B0746TMZ3S,2021,the United States

Sound","As the owner of some Sennheiser HD700's (as well as the HD600, HD650, HD6XX, and HD660S), I wanted to see what the headphones were capable of when running off of a balanced headphone amp.  I picked up a Schiit Jotunheim with the balanced DAC module, and I ordered this cable (and the other model for the HD6xx line).  Having read some not-so-good reviews of several bargain cables that were available, I decided to go with a genuine Sennhieser cable.  Yes, this is a PRICEY cable, but the quality is excellent.  It has the exact same build (and length) as the single-ended cable that came with the HD700's; the only difference being the 4-pin XLR connector.  I resisted using the cable right away, and I spent quite a few hours getting used to the sound of the HD700's on the Jotunheim with the single-ended cable.  When I finally made the switch, I was absolutely blown away!  I was honestly like getting a new pair of glasses: everything suddenly came into perfect focus.  The clarity, the separation, the placement of elements in the space, the control of the highs, the depth and impact of the bass, the realism imparted into the sound, everything just sounded (noticeably) better.  Not to mention the added power the Jotunheim can deliver when using a balanced cable.  If you're on the fence about the benefit of using a balanced amp I highly recommend you find a way to give it a shot.  If you want to be sure the cable you're buying will be high quality and durability, this cable won't let you down.  I'm excited to hear what my HD6xx series headphones sound like when that cable arrives.  If you have any specific questions please let me know.",5,B00H8AEZOC,2017,the United States

Also, i don't like that wrap around the back of the head design. The right earbud has a much longer cable.

Comparing side by side with the old MDR-E828s, I find these to be a bit fuller of sound.  The lows cut out around 50Hz and the highs go as high as I can hear.  So these have the dynamic range to suit me.

The best part is they fit in the old Sony wind up case!

My preferred set for almost a year and a half was broken by accident, and I wanted to stick with a pair that had an inline mic and volume control. These phones sounded great, were comfortable, and were virtually silent with the cables over the ears. What was not great, was that these stopped working as desired 40 days after I bought them. They were plugged in 10-12 times max, cable was transported properly just as many times, and the dreaded broken internal cable happens. I understand lemons can happen, and don't generally fault a DOA pair of headphones, but these breaking with virtually no use and after the return deadline means I will be without my money and any headphones while I wait for warranty support.

I was planning to take them for a run but I'm afraid i'll break them or to have to be fitting them again every 5 steps.
Definitely not what I was expecting for 80 dlls.

R3A72DWYK01KNI,... home repair on the ear pads they still sound amazing - so when i decided to buy some In-Ear ...,"I've owned the same pair of Sennheiser HD595 audiophiles for over 6 yrs now and aside from doing a home repair on the ear pads they still sound amazing - so when i decided to buy some In-Ear phones for the phone i knew i'd start with Sennheiser.
Buying even IEM's without first having a test listen was rather risky.
I knew In-Ear were never going to sound as good as Open headphones (for similar price) but the CX 880i are damn close.
Whether from an amp, or just through my phone the sound stage and volume quality is excellent.
Clarity is amazing at all areas of the spectrum.

Although specifically designed for iphones - most of the functions do work on Android.
I have been using them with my old HTC HD2 (originally had Windows 6.5 OS)
I've tried several variants of Android from 2.3 upto 4.4 and all functions work except the rocker (- and +). These have all been custom Android ROMS and phone is rooted, so for those whose haven't worked perhaps that's where the problem lies
Answer/Hangup - Mic, play and pause all work.

Only real gripe about the CX880i is the ear-bud rubbers. To start with with can be very fickle. For the first several days i was constantly pulling them out and sticking them in trying to arrange them for the proper sound. If not seated properly they sound bassless and hollow.
Even now on seldom occasions i have to re-seat.

2 yrs on - after using 3 to 4 times a week, the build quality is as new

I'd suggest getting a different brand.",2,B004CQNTF6,2013,the United States
R9444EA6OTYN0,All and more than I have come to expect from Sennheiser,"I love the sound quality. I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile, but I did try a cheaper brand and found I had to have music up louder and then create distortion. This model has the 'noise isolation' feature, which I assume is just due to a snug fit in the ear canal. But whatever it is it works, I find I can't hear people talking or other music over mine like I used to (even with my previous Sennheiser), so that's been good. The controls are easy to use, once you remember all the buttons etc. I use these for music, calls, Skype and even running. Their not designed or marketed for running, so I can except that they're not so good for it, mainly because the mic is too high and jumps around when you run, if it was a little longer I could tuck it into the collar of my shirt, mind you though I haven't used the cable clip yet, so that will probably alleviate this issue. In short would recommend these to anyone who likes quality sound at a reasonable price from a reliable manufacturer, but doesn't want to pay 0.5K for it.",5,B004CQNTF6,2013,the United States

RLZKTK6QR1MVT,Sennhalfeiser,"Way out of balance, right earplug playing at roughly quarter of the volume of the left one. Performance ( or lack thereof ) verified with a number of mono sources. Unforgivable lapse in quality control, considering the hefty price tag, even £2 a set headphones get this essential bit right using off the mill transducers and rudimentary assembly practices. Sound quality is probably very high though, with a fully working set. Awaiting exchange.

Replacement set arrived swiftly, and yes, both earpieces work as intended this time. Sound quality is much improved in comparison to bottom end Sennheiser offerings - an avalanche of detail peppering spacious and clean cut background, in which vocals flourish. At times, it is almost scary, when previously glanced over effects pop into existence and tend to make you look around inadvertently. There is enough excess bass to deliver plenty of thump, even with background rumble onboard the tube or buses. It goes deep, its quality and general feel is greatly improved compared to cheaper models, with the emphasis placed in the lowest register, thus avoiding the trap of monotonous, overblown midbass ruining the show. In a quiet environment however, a balanced sound is restored by attenuating the lower end by about 4-5dB. Lightweight cable is terribly microphonic and unlikely to survive an unintentional tangle and a snag - handle with care. Noise isolation is impressive and piece to ear seal maintained under most circumstances. 3/5 stars, but if your main consideration is purely sound quality, you may add another one or two.",1,B00365EVWE,2016,the United Kingdom

Other than that, they sound great and, as earbuds, are of course extremely portable, just be careful with them like any earbuds not to wind them too tight when storing them.

I had thought one side died, so I stopped using them for a while and tried some Shure SE215's. I was not a fan at all of how those are placed in the ear, so I went back to the Sennheisers and realized I just had to clean these CX870's a bit more throughly, and now they sound great again.

I have tried other much more expensive buds with mutliple drivers, etc, and I always come back to these for the fit. They are small - the body of the housing does not try to sit against the outer ear like most other buds - the fit is entirely the tips inside the ear canals. I guess I have shallow outer ears, because the larger bodies of most buds gets in the way of the shafts fitting comfortably. I use Comply foam tips, and the seal is effortless, quick and perfect. They sound great. Added benefit - we have a mono monitor mix, and these buds have identical shape at each ear, no mirror image left/right, so it isn't necessary to figure out which goes in which ear. The cables are thin, but my bandmates and I have used these for over 5 years and not one has had issues. A super bargain, highly recommended.",5,B0018Z7EIM,2024,the United States

R223IG1Y5H4U4P,Excellent balanced sound when using the right size ear pads.,"Sound quality is very dependant on using the right size ear pads for your ears.  I used the medium pads that were already fitted & the sound lacked definition in the bottom 2 octaves unless I pushed the buds into my ears which indicated I needed to use the large ear pads or inserts as others call them.  Once I switched to the large pads the sound became much more balanced with great bass response that is accurate & exteneded without being 'puffy' or bloated.  Mids & highs are very detailed & I hear little details in the sound that quite frankly were missing from my old Sens in ear phones that these replaced.  I've been a long time fan of Sennheiser headphones as they seem to be the most accurate phones with an excellent sensitivity & dynamic range while giving a great overall sound, even without any equalization at all.  They are perfect as monitor headphones when recording on my 3-Head Denon deck.

Big issue: the contact port does not fit with my bf's phone case, nor does it fit with my ipod case. The whole reason why I bought these was to get him to stop using my earbuds.
They do work with my phone case, however, and I have ended up using them,  while the bf has taken over my original, better pair.

That and the fact that they are very small and I can lay on them with no trouble were big selling points. I'm on my second pair because I wore the first pair to death. The first pair still works, but is rough around the edges. The sound quality is flat. They sound like flat studio monitors frequency wise to me, pretty much.

The fit is perfect and comes with a variety of earpieces, including the option to remove the random yellow thing that sticks out.

R18T9F9JA7NPQP,Pretty good but what about the magnet?,"1) Sound quality: is pretty good for this price point and application, better than many of the others I have tried (perhaps a dozen over the years). I use them exclusively for voice as the sound is too thin for music.
2) Fit: is acceptable, better than my recent Sony's but still not as good as some Anker's I have had in the past. They fall out more than I would like and I am still trying different wings and ear-rubbers.  They also tend to slide when I use them for cycling (daily) and I need to adjust them every 30 minutes or so to keep one or the other earbud from pulling out.  I have yet to be happy with the way the control and battery pods interface with the straps of my helmet.
3) The problem: the big problem is that they do not have magnets to keep them together when I have them around my neck.  I wear mine all day, every day and I need them to stay put, also when I am NOT using them.  These, even when I stuff them inside my shirt, tend to slide around (the right-side controls appear to be a little heavier than the battery pod, and so they usually slide in that direction) and even fall from my neck.  Twice I have lost them entirely from under my shirt and had to go searching to find where they had dropped to the floor/ground.  This situation is about the only time I appreciate the bright-yellow trim as I could find them quickly.

R1OZDGH9658XNM,but I was kind of surprised at how bad these sound,"I know these aren't that expensive, and you always get what you pay for, but I was kind of surprised at how bad these sound.  The sound is very muddy.  I listen to jazz, classical music, and latin pop.  My $10 skullcandy earbuds actually handle all my playlists better than these do.  Especially the classical music!  These muffle the highs, the lows, and the midranges.  They are fairly comfortable to wear, though, so I'm giving them 3 stars to average out 2 stars for sound quality and 4 stars for comfort.

These are basically just &#34;listening to&#34; headphones; not really for mixing. They're even available at my local drug store.

As far as low cost headphones go, these are perfect. Good price, good quality. These are not expensive headphones. It's a plastic build with a synthetic leather pad. But, then, I paid under $30 so...

I got these for work, and for this purpose, they're perfect. No so isolative that I can't hear things around me, but loud enough to be immersive in music and youtube videos. If you're looking for an isolating headphone, this is not it.

The bass response is pretty high. And the phones are a little bit mushy because of this. The response is good, but not really crisp. (Full disclaimer, I'm a musician and have more than one set of very expensive headphones.)

For all that, these are great bang for the buck. As long as you have an expectation of what you're buying them for.",5,B00CXP4AS8,2016,the United States

R3Q2ITOHLCSBGA,"THE GOLDEN EAR approves, with a cheap fix.","I am an amateur connoisseur of music and sound quality.  Music is part of my soul.  I'll be honest--I'm a snob.  And though I know one of my ears hears slightly differently from the other due to my adventures with loudspeakers, I can still safely say my sense for quality sound reproduction is what you would call ""golden.""  I am also a cheapskate, which is a hardship, considering my taste.

That being the case, I was only slightly disappointed in these headphones at first.  At a realistic (reasonably loud) volume for vocals and/or symphony orchestra, the highest treble is too harsh and sounds like its breaking up, obscuring all fine detail and hurting your ear.  I'm not sure if that is because of the shape of the ear pieces or if it is an intrinsic imperfection of the diaphragm itself, such as break-up at the resonant frequency.  I suspect the latter.

But don't get me wrong.  These are excellent headphones for the price, and the ear is most sensitive to and very picky about treble or high frequencies.

Fortunately, I was able to apply a real cheapskate fix to the problem.  For both earpieces, I folded over a small square of material from a bath-towel, and covered the upper half of the diaphragm cover in the earpiece, tucking the edges under the ear pads to secure it.  And the sound is far better.  It really does sound realistic, ALMOST as if you are listening live in the front row of a theatre.  Less picky ears than mine won't know the difference at all.

The bass range is excellent, down to ~10 Hz.  The earphones are very comfortable and sturdy as well.  However, I will rate this item on its intrinsic worth and not by price.  So it receives only 4 stars--but only because, mind you, without a fix, it does not sound as good as mixing-quality headphones should.

I hope I have been of some assistance.",4,B00CXP4AS8,2014,the United States
RI64NAHSY2523,Perfect as part of a wired setup for letting one's spouse/partner watch TV in bed while the other lays in blissful silence.,"If my girlfriend and I go to bed early enough to make me happy then she almost always wants to watch a show which prevented me from falling asleep because I just can't tune it out. For this particular application I chose to go with a wired setup because the biggest advantage of wireless (mobility) was irrelevant since it's not like she was going to be wearing these around the house; she was going to be using them night-after-night in the same location. Therefore the disadvantages of a wireless setup (extra weight of the electronics package and batteries, poor sound quality, poor and/or intermittent reception) weren't worth it. I needed to get the audio signal from the RCA line-out &#34;line out&#34; jacks on the cable box to her ears 20 or so feet away so (in addition to these headphones) I got the following:
1) a Male RCA to Female 3.5mm adapter http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I23TTE/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2) a 50' &#34;headphone&#34; (3.5mm) extension cable http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0XPCE8/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and
3) a tiny headphone amp that would take the &#34;line out&#34; signal and boost it to headphone level. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T6NZMS/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The Adapter plugs into the cable box on the dresser and feeds the extension cable which is long enough to run along the baseboard and up behind her nightstand to then hit the headphone amp on her nightstand. The amp on her nightstand is nice because it gives her volume control, mute, and has an on/off switch since it's an active (powered) unit (this particular model uses a battery but others are available that use a powered wall adapter or USB power, etc.)

At the time of my purchase these headphones and all the goodies listed above were 87 bucks and I'm so happy I could do a little dance. She put them on and watched a video and I couldn't hear ANYTHING.",5,B00CXP4AS8,2015,the United States

I expected a significant drop in audio quality but it was ok, they were beaters! Let me say simply amazing!!!!! They are not expensive but they dont sound cheap/tinny at all. I am amazed at the sound reproduction (a little bass heavy) but overall a solid solid low cost high performance offering from sony with the build quality to match. Heavy wire construction(no shorts) comfortable fit for varying head sizes good drivers. I would not hesitate to put them up against products costing 5,6,7 times as much and I am an audiophile.

R3H43S3ZB05T3Q,Decent headphones for the price,"Pros:  Pretty good value overall.  I like the color (white), which look pretty slick (if that's what you're going for).  Have had a couple people come up and ask me about them, just because they look pretty high-quality and cool.  The headphones are pretty much the perfect size (as in they don't look like studio headphones) and they fit snugly on your ears.  Also like the fact that the ear phones can turn sideways for storage.

Cons:  The headphones themselves have a weird bend to them and stick out funny from your head.  Had I actually seen them on, I probably wouldn't have bought them.  Sound is ok - pretty much what you would expect at this price range.  The sound quality is ok, but the bass isn't all that great.  Take the 5 star ratings with a grain of salt, as they should definitely not be compared to any of the higher quality headphones.",4,B00CXP4AS8,2013,the United States
R8BO32IBCYO06,"Not as 'cool' as Beats, but your wallet will thank you","I looked long and hard comparing expensive headphones such as Beats and Bose, but decided for a cheaper, but for my purposes, comparable product with these Sony headphones. Both my bank account and I were thrilled with the decision in the end. I've had these headphones for 9 months now and, although I am sure I would have been satisfied with the flashier and &#34;cool&#34; Beats or Bose headphones, I am extremely satisfied with my Sony headphones. My main purpose in seeking out headphones to replace the standard earphones was the noise canceling component with a hint of better sound quality. I am by NO means a sound/music guru that dissects the specifics of headphones; I just want something that looks good, sounds good, and is of good quality. These headphones do just that for me. They are very light weight, the cushions fold in for easier transportation and storage, and the sound quality is FOR MY PURPOSES great! I have no complaints with these headphones and I am very happy that I did not spend the extra $100+ on Beats or Bose headphones.

They fit over your ear, but don't fit correctly no matter how hard you try to adjust them. The sound quality is awful, you have to turn your speakers all the way up to even hear anything because of how they fit (or don't fit) on your ears.

R2GE9UM0TJKIE6,"Not what I expected, here's why...","These headphones look very cute on amazon, and for some reason I didn't expect to receive such plastic looking headphones. I mean, I paid 16 bucks for them, not 6, so I wanted them to reflect that. I do, however, like the color, but they definitely look and feel like a nice hunk of plastic on my head, even my brother agreed lol. They are however comfortable on me, and I do like the color, but I think they just look too cheap. I don't mind plastic headphones, but when it's SO obvious that they are made of plastic because of their appearance (like in these headphones)- I have a problem. Unfortunately another bad thing is the sound. I mean it's just okay, it's really not that good though, and I'm not the picky type. Basically if you bought these for music, you will notice that your favorite song sounds more like a regular recording then music, it's just missing the richness/fullness in the music that headphones should deliver to you. I will say, though, that certain genres do sound better on these headphones than others.  However in my opinion, these headphones would be better for watching youtube videos of people talking or reading an audio book. Anything with music or even theatrics will not be as greatly heard through these headphones. If you do plan on purchasing these (the price is still pretty decent for a pair of headphones) I'll just say that you'll see what I mean for yourself.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend these headphones for those who are seeking headphones mainly for music, because you're probably not going to be very satisfied. Also I want to warn that these headphones look kind of cheap, if I keep them I will probably just wear them at home. I just bought the Sony mdr zx310's and I'm going to determine which is better for me.

R3N6Q5CF2FD6PJ,A few problems with these headphones but...,"I usually don't leave 3 star reviews but I thought this is a product I should leave a detailed review on. First, the headphones are gorgeous. A very pretty pink color and also very comfortable to wear, more so than my skullcandy's which is why I haven't returned them yet. However, pretty soon after I opened them I noticed there's an odd static like noise that hums just under the music. It's really annoying. A quick fix I found was just unplugging and plugging it back in, eventually it goes away with that or some wriggling of the cord. I know it's nothing I did to them myself since it was like that as soon as I tested them. With that said, definitely don't buy this at the original retail price which IIRC was around $30 - $40? I got these on sale for $18 which is why I waited after seeing the reviews to buy them. I think these are definitely worth $15 at the most. The quality is okay, not any better than similarly priced headphones. I think if you're serious about high quality headphones, skip these.

Then for Christmas I got them again remember how I said that one was in a clear plastic bag well the one I got at Christmas was in really nice packaging and I realized that the one I got was probably used.

I have been in the radio industry for 24 years and I'v warned tons of headphones, personally I'm a huge fan of &#34;most of Sony's headphones...I would say you won't be disappointed but I will say this,  the way the headphones turn sideways makes me question if it's suitable for a six-year-old now my daughter is extremely patient and she knows how to treat something right if you have a child who just doesn't care and stretches out of headphone these will break they fit me and I'm a six foot man and it fits the head and my 6 year old daughter and they sound great. You should get a minimum of 10 years out of them. By then the pads on the ears will start to flake or crack, now don't let this discourage you... this is that the 10-12 year mark.

Comfort? Kind of for about 45minutes to an hour, then it's pain city, top and sides.
Noise cancelling is great though.
It really struggled to pair with my google tv properly, would say it was connected but the sound was still not coming through them would have to disconnect and reconnect every time.

They would also randomly not turn on sometimes, like I would try to turn them on and nothing would happen, have to just come back and try again 15 minutes later, never really had moody electronics before.

R1AVFQ2DNNL4AI,Don't buy yet (maybe wait for a new batch?),"After using the WH-1000XM3s for 2 years and being delighted with them, it seemed low risk to upgrade to the XM4s and get basically the same headphones but with better ANC and multi-device support.

While they seem like an incremental upgrade in every way (and worked great for a little while), I had major problems with static/crackling coming from the right earphone after a few hours of use. I returned that pair to Amazon and received a new pair super fast (fantastic customer service as usual). However, after a few days the replacement pair developed the same issue!

After some research I found that apparently it's to do with condensation building up in the ear cup and interfering with the ANC, which is not properly insulated (wtf sony). The problem seems a bit too widespread for comfort, and coupled with my anecdotal evidence, this is deal breaker for me on a $550 pair of headphones. Won't be trying a third pair.

RQ30UUZQYI2P1,Don't buy if you plan on using for them for work calls,"I bought these after returning a set of Bose 700's that were rendered unusable after a very poor quality Bose firmware release. Whilst the Sony's sound great and have excellent bass, I found them to be unusable for calls.. I use the headphones on an iPhone, iPad pro and a MacBook Pro. For work I use a variety of conference call facilities including Zoom, MS Teams, Webex and mobile calls and in all cases I received complaints that I was inaudible, muffled, distant, quiet or sounded like I was in a tunnel. In addition instead of minimising/reducing  external noise while on calls, weirdly they seemed to pick up or enhance surrounding noise such as kids yelling which other participants on the calls commented on.  In a working from home environment or a noisey office this is not good. So unfortunately the Sony's will be returned as well. I very much wanted to love them  but I also found them to be slightly more uncomfortable than the 700s. For me, the Sony's just felt so much bigger on my head and as a result they tended to feel like they were constantly slipping off my head if I moved too much. Maybe I just have a small or weirdly shaped head, but I also felt a slight pressure point at the top of my head in the middle of the headband.
I have since repurchased the Bose 700s (after what seems like a better firmware releases v 1.7) and it's now blindingly obvious the Bose 700's are head and shoulders above the Sony when it comes to call quality in terms of both clarity and blocking outside noises. If I could I would keep the Sony's for listening to music and the keep the Bose 700s for work.  However to me the Bose do an ok job on the music front but are excellent for calls, so I'll be keeping those.  Fingers crossed Bose firmware continues to improve.",3,B08F4WX2PM,2020,Australia

EQ function available via the app. Works well for tweaking the sound quality.

Great ANC headphone for the frequent flyer. Love that it folds up for a smaller footprint for storage - the main reason for choosing this over the xm5 which can't fold up.

They’re the perfect carry on for your flight thanks to their long battery life and exceptional ANC, and are well-worth it for frequent travelers.  Usually you’re forced to pick between a pair of noise-cancelling headphones that do a good job of blocking outside noise, or ones that excel at audio playback. The Sony WH-1000XM4 is great at both, meaning you don’t have to pick.  The only drawback is while the Sony WH-1000XM4 are the best ANC headphones to use when listening to music, but they still lack in good call quality while on your phone.

The ""vibrations"" that are transferred through bone conduction are just regular speakers that rest in front of your ears. I literally get the exact same sound quality when I hold my phone speaker to my head just in front of my ear.

R1PWQ3UFW9D0WT,"Awful design and quality, I'm unsure what people love about these headphones","First off, if you wear glasses or have long hair DO NOT PURCHASE THESE. They will slide off, not fit, and rip out your hair constantly. I've been trying to make these headphones work for a month now and I just can't enjoy them.

I am a cyclist and I bought these to hear street traffic while outside, as well as when I'm around the house and working on things. I have long hair and glasses and I have to perform a ritual every time I put these on, if I put them on with my helmet and glasses in the wrong order then I have to take everything off and do it again, usually pulling out hair in the process.

While cycling the headphones create a wind tunnel that makes it more difficult to both hear the music and the street noise. The way to counter this is to turn up the volume ... which then makes it even more difficult to hear the street noise again.

My hair and glasses makes it so that these are constantly sliding further and further away from the optimal placement for sound volume/quality. I'm left with diminishing volume as I continue my ride, which results in me turning up the volume to the point that it's a full volume and I can still have trouble hearing the music.

I'm going to simply state that if you like a full range of audio sounds from both treble, mid, and bass, do not buy these headphones. You will get treble and some mids, but bass is just vibrations that make my ears feel uncomfortable.

The only positive is that yes, these headphones allow you to hear the things going on around you. The battery life is not 10 hours, the sound is awful, they're uncomfortable, they're not adjustable, and they're not designed for moving at speeds faster than a jog.

I honestly can't believe that so many people recommended these to me. I'm going back to my $40 true wireless ear buds and just putting in one of the two in. This still allows me to hear traffic sounds, get quality audio, not have sliding, and not getting my hair ripped out constantly. Do not fall for the novelty of this product.",1,B09BVYK4J2,2024,the United States
R1E4Z4X1JOJUBQ,DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE!,"I purchased the Shokz OpenRun Pro so I could hear ambient sounds (e.g. my wife or children, vehicles, etc. ) while listening to my favorite music, videos, or podcasts, and they were highly recommended by a relative. Here are my reasons why I will not purchase these again, nor influence anyone else to do so:
- ""Open ear comfort"" (nope): For use longer than 5 minutes, they really become uncomfortable. I have to stop my listening, remove them, and massage the areas above my ears where they sit, before I can continue what I was listening to. I've never had to do this with any of my other headphones over the years, including earbuds and other over-the-ear headphones.
- ""Premium sound quality"" (nope): I figured the sound quality would not be great, but the quality was definitely worse than expected. I would not market these as ""Enhanced Bass With Incredible Depth"". I know it's marketing hype, but really!?
- When sliding them on and off, they grab and pull my hair. I have very short hair but they still manage to accomplish it somehow. It's really annoying and very unpleasant. I've never had this with any other type of headphones I've owned. My wife could tell you how big a deal this is to me as I won't let her pluck my eyebrows anymore because of how much I detest the feeling of hair being pulled from my face or head. If you like this sensation, there's probably something wrong with you...this is definitely not a desired feature thus intentionally omitted from the feature set (They pull on your hair, whether it's long or short...your wife will love it).
- The notification sound when changing a setting (e.g. volume up or down) is excessive. This just needs to be a very sight sound, not one blasting in your ear. This is really aggravating when you're listening to something in a quiet environment and you want to adjust the volume a little lower or higher and the notification sound completely wrecks the experience by blaring its existence. TURN DOWN THE NOTIFICATION dB's!
- For $180, you'd think it would come with its own wall outlet charging adapter...NOPE.
So many people justify and rationalize their purchases because they spent a lot of money...not me. I can admit a bad decision when I make one, and this was definitely one of them. I was planning on purchasing Shokz for my entire family but wanted to try them out before committing (I'm sure glad I did vs giving into the influence of others). At least I'm only stuck with this one vs. five, and my pocketbook thanks me for it.
***If you're dead set on purchasing these, do yourself a favor and just get the least expensive option. The benefits are not noticeable as I compared mine with my niece's. She paid around $70 and they're basically the same thing...just $110 less expensive. But still...will it be worth it?",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2022,the United States
R17ILWJ2J4SGWM,(Updated) Different Headphone Experience,"Final update:  Just over a year of use and they do not turn on. These things have terrible audio, voices are distorted on the phone and very difficult to understand. Music sounds terrible. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!

I bought these to replace my apple AirPod Pros and was quite skeptical as I had not tried bone conductive headphones before purchasing. My initial impression of them wasn’t that good as they don’t sound like traditional headphones. The high frequency sounds do not come through and as a drummer I noticed all cymbal sounds almost disappear, delicate guitar, piano or string instruments don’t sound as clear as they would with traditional headphones either. Wearing hearing protection like earplugs does work but will muffle the sound, but that is not what these were made for. If I want to have music playing and still be aware of what is going on around me, these are perfect. Play metal music all day long and not bother the scared little people you work with because you have good taste in music and still be able to hear your coworkers gossip! Phone calls sound crisp and clear, much better than using my phone on my ear. The microphone has noise cancelling that works very well. The headphones themselves are not noise cancelling. Anyone who wants noise cancelling bone conductive headphones is asking for a product that would give them a migraine after minutes of use. These are not headphones to use in noisy environments as they are not designed for that use for your own health. They are comfortable to wear for the entire day, I can wear a touque or hat and it doesn’t affect the performance. The battery keeps charge well after one month of use, will update if things change.

(Update) After 7 months of use my findings are as follows;
Battery life is still excellent,
Headphone connection gets dropped intermittently while playing audio,
Headphones will lose connection during phone calls and drop calls,
Left side speakers have developed a buzzing sound like a speaker is blown,
App is cumbersome to use and is quite useless other than to pair to multiple sources,
Lack of proper EQ for the headset as other less expensive Bluetooth headphones allow,
Apple integration is subpar,
I’m not convinced these are true “bone conductive” headphones as placing the drivers right over your ears not only sounds louder it makes the sound much clearer.

I had rated these as a 5 star product but after 7 months of use I actually regret this purchase. As the flagship pro model, this headset is not worth the price even on sale.",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2022,Canada
RF0SYI88F8Y6Y,Emperors new clothes,"I have read so many reviews of this product on Amazon and tech websites everybody agrees its the best of the best , there's no bone conduction headphones better so I was super excited to get these.

WRONG! I wear headphone a lot and the two environments I wear them are quiet office and running (next to busy roads) These are useless for both. The are NOT bone conducting at all, either I am doing something wrong or they are mis-sold, I am confused as almost EVERYBODY thinks they are great but they are just tiny speakers that offer poor sound, like an ear bud but that sit outside of your ear the result is HUGE sound bleed in a quiet environment everyone can hear it louder than if you put a pair of ear buds on the table and because the sound is SOOOO weak in a noisy environment you cant hear them. I tried then vs my poor quality JLAB epic air earbuds that they were supposed to replace and the JLab offer MUCH better sound and they are much cheaper (I don't actual like them that much) I also tried them Vs my old wired Sony MDR-XB50AP and despite being old are the best sound quality so far but then I tried my wife's cans (I'm not keen on cans) Sony WH-CH710N and they smashed all of them to bits so I might have to go with cans in future.

RC43F6MQUJR3L,Absolutely dumbfounded how these are popular,"First of all, these are more like orange than pink. Second of all, they aren’t comfortable. I can already see the sides of my face breaking out, because the little nub sits right against your skin, where I am already prone to acne because of greasy hair or what not. It’s flush to the cheek skin. Second of all, there is the rigid band that goes around the back of your head. So you can’t wear a long hat, or God forbid your ponytail bobs against it, moving the entire earpiece.  The charger is completely unique to the product so it’s not like you can just grab somebody’s random USB-C, in fact, I was watching one of my favorite Instagram runners, and she got to her marathon, but forgot the charging cable so had to go on a frantic search to find somebody who had one I was happily using my anker soundcore earbuds with ear, loops and little pod case that has USB-C charging, but I saw shokz all over Instagram. I figured they must be fantastic if they are so popular. I have no idea how anybody tolerates these. The massive carrying case compared to a tiny earbud case, the obscure charger, nubs sitting against your face.

I can hear traffic just fine with my anker sound core earbuds. Just wear one at a time and the carrying case is so small similar to AirPods that you can just stick it in your running vest or pocket and switch the earbuds out although mine last for hours and hours. What happens when your shokz dies? I highly doubt anybody is sticking the massive carrying case in a purse while out running…. When it dies it dies compared to a pair of earbuds where you can just alternate wearing one earbud at a time.

Anker soundcore don’t fall off either because they have ear loops, but they’re not pressing against your face, they’re on the back of your ear

It is baffling to me how anybody even wears these. I returned them immediately. Even worse is that they are three times the cost of my sound core earbuds. These are even more expensive than Apple AirPods.  Crazy!",1,B09BVYK4J2,2023,the United States

Pros:
 • Comfort: The headphones are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods. They fit well and don’t cause any discomfort, even during long listening sessions.
 • Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. Several hrs of use and still left with 70% EOD.

Cons:

 • Noise Distortion: Unfortunately, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. There’s noticeable noise distortion, which makes them unsuitable for making calls.
 • Tingling Sensation: When the volume is above 60%, I experienced a strange tingling sensation on my cheeks, which is quite unpleasant.
 • Stereo Sound: The stereo sound is very flat with zero bass, which really detracts from the overall listening experience.
 • Noise Cancelling: If you’re looking for noise-canceling headphones and have kids at home, these are definitely not the right choice. They don’t provide the noise-canceling effect you’d expect.

Overall, while the comfort and battery life are great, the poor sound quality and other issues make these headphones hard to recommend.",2,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,India
R2G97DFOHDCT6D,Niche product with too many compromises,"A significant part of why I buy headphones is the sound quality. When it comes to bone conducting headphones, you'll see lots of comments about ""excellent sound"" but I get the impression that these enthusiasts and converts are being charitable because this is a niche product with specific advantages over traditional earbuds. The advantages aren't nothing, but there is still a purpose that headphones serve, and these fail to serve it well.

What isn't conveyed in the glowing reviews is how bone conducting headphones compare to your average in-ear earphones. These headphones sound like the equivalent, or worse, than playing music through your phone speaker and holding near your ear.

The limited advantages are really what you're paying for with these bone conducting headphones.

- They are lightweight and don't move around a lot on your noggin. This is good for active wear and I see why this is a major advantage for people who have problem with earbuds staying put.

- If you have allergies or irritations to traditional earbuds, these would be a fine compromise, particularly if you're using them for sports or exercise.

- Comfort is subjective one for me. Their light weight is alleviates this, but there are some unique pressure points. There is a light but constant pressure on and in front of your tragus (that little ear flap that sticks out in the front of your ear), since that's where the speakers rest. Overall, I can see how the light weight would make this tolerable after some time.

- When playing music or podcasts, these little speakers vibrate, so you will either get used to a persistent buzzing at the front of your ear as a ""bass enhancing effect"" or it might just annoy you. The buzzing was difficult for me to get used to.

- The band that wraps around the back of your head protrudes enough so that lying back on a surface (headrest, bench, etc) pushes the headset forward, out of whack, and against the back of your ears. The severity of this issue may depend on the size you choose. I got the regular, but some reviews have mentioned this is less of a problem with the mini.

- I wear glasses most of the time, and these headphones did overlap the temples of my glasses. If you wear glasses, you may or may not have to rearrange your glasses to stack on the sides of the headset. I found the pressure from the speakers on my ears more annoying than the overlapping on my glasses though.

- While the feel of the headset is generally comfortable and light, the vibration from sound works against the comfort for long listening sessions. If you're coming from the inner ear pressure discomfort of earbuds, you may be trading that discomfort for a persistent buzzing on your ears.

- As an experiment, play some music on your phone speaker and hold it near your ear. Depending on the quality of your phone speakers, the Shoks bone conducting headphones will sound the same or worse than that. Somehow, the Shoks seem to have less bass than my phone speakers. I don't count the speaker vibrating on my ear as bass because it's simply a poor facsimile for actual bass. This headset might actually be better without the vibration. These might be ok for podcasts and audiobooks, but the vibration seems really unnecessary for those media types.

- Obviously there is no noise cancelling to consider, by design. But I'm even skeptical of the transparency features of the form factor. If you're playing these reasonably loud, the sound still blocks the clarity of any outside noise that isn't pretty loud. You're basically playing a tiny speaker next to your ear, so transparency relies on the noisiness of your environment. The transparency features in earbuds tend to work better for this in my experience because they can attenuate the audio more and amplify outside noises. With the Shoks, you simply get background noise with no filtering or amplification.

Any around the neck speaker is a superior alternative to bone conducting headphones, at least for non-active use cases. I have a Bose Soundwear around-the-neck speaker and it's comfortable, sounds awesome, allows me to hear my environment, and has great battery life. The transparency is superior because nothing is actually positioned directly in front of your ears.

This Shoks headset is simply an alternative form factor for active people who don't want, or can't have, earbuds in their ears. It is not a legitimate alternative to more traditional headphones including earbuds if you care even a little about sound quality. The sound quality is not really acceptable, especially for the price.",2,B09BVXT8TJ,2023,the United States
R3M1PZIMQQM3LA,get uncomfortable on a longer workout,"Initially I thought these would be a great set of headphones for running while also being able to hear the traffic (for safety reasons9.

However I have soon noticed that they get uncomfortable, even after a short time of wearing. I hafe found following things to be irretating:
1. The arch going over your ear is rather sharp and sits/ cuts in the top of where your ear attaches
2. when turning up the volume the vibration is very noticeable and will soon get irretating (at lower volumes its fine, but as soon as you are outside you will have to turn up the volume to hear anything)
3. In colder weather, the size and form of the loop going around the back of your head connecting the two earpieces is to big/ the wrong shape to be able to wear a hat over it which covers your ears
4. The duration you have to hold the on/off switch is way too long. If the device is off, a simple pressing of the button should turn it on (I think you have to hold for a full 2 seconds). And turning off, which could be about 2 seconds I think is 5 seconds (alternatively start/pause buttong could be used as on/off but with eaqually shorter holding times)
5. it does not have wireless charging i.e. you now have to keep a device specific charging cable on hand (I see why it would not be USB C, based on the size and waterproofing and the magnetic connect works well and feels very nice. But it is annoying and seems a bit dated to have to have a dedicated charger)

If shokz are reading this, I,d be happy to try a pair of OpenRun Mini and comment if they are any better when it comes to comfort.

Hope it the feedback helps with your decision making.",2,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United Kingdom
R2KW5J8VJD9RG4,Convenience cannot outweigh quality,"I won't bury the lede here: I returned this item after having used/tested it pretty thoroughly over the course of a week. To be clear, I'm not saying ""don't buy this item"". I'm simply saying ""this item wasn't for me"".

I'll start by explaining the reason I purchased in the first place, it might add some key context others can relate to. I listen to music/podcasts basically every day, I run a few times a week and walk the dog most days as well. During these activities I've always got headphones of some sort on. I used to be a big fan of earbuds - they're pretty much the perfect solution for me. Or at least, were the perfect solution. I've found in recent weeks I've started to get slight ear pains and am finding them more and more uncomfortable, whilst being able to wear them for shorter and shorter periods of time. And I'm fairly sure it's starting to have a very slight impact on my hearing as well. Perhaps not a surprise - I guess jamming bits of silicon into your ear canal and listening to loud music on a daily basis probably isn't the best from a health perspective. Over-ear headphones are fine around the house but a pretty inconvenient solution when out and about, I find at least.

So that's when I came across the OpenRun Pro headphones. Bone conduction is a very interesting piece of technology, and offering me the chance to listen without actually having my ears covered was extremely appealing. So after reading many reviews, I pulled the trigged and ordered a pair to try for myself.

Here are my main thoughts:

COMFORT
========
I read so many reviews where people said something along the lines of ""I forgot I was wearing them at all!"". Wow, I envy these people. Apparently I must have super sensitive ears or something, the first few hours I had them on I found them extremely uncomfortable. To the point they made my ears rather sore. To be fair, this did get better over time, but I still found that wearing them for any significant amount of time would bring back some level of soreness/uncomfortableness. I was CONSTANTLY adjusting the placement on my head, seemingly unable to find the ""sweet spot"" where comfort was acceptable and sound quality was adequate (more on that shortly). But I could never seem to crack that. Oftentimes, everything would be fine, then I'd move my head slightly and I'd hit ""dead spots"" of sound where it became slightly muted. Quite frustrating. I couldn't work out whether it was better to have the band higher up so it was touching the back of my head, or lower down so it was floating freely. In all honestly, it was much of a muchness, but nevertheless I literally couldn't go a minute or two without adjusting it.

SOUND QUALITY
=============
Obviously with a product like this, there has to be some compromise. I bought them with expectations that sound quality wasn't going to be anything like that of earbuds or over-ear headphones - it simply can't be. However, even with these expectations I was disappointed. The sound quality isn't average, I'd go as far as to say it's downright bad. For podcasts, it's not so much of a problem. For music, it just sounds like you're listening to a really terrible quality recording. I don't consider myself an audiophile by any stretch -  I don't mess around with EQ or anything like that, but even I felt the quality was extremely sub-standard.

CONVENICENCE
============
So this is where the OpenRun Pro does tick a box. Sort of. I found the fact they don't actually cover your ears to be quite convenient in certain situations. Mostly, if there is other noise in your vicinity you need to tune into instead, it's very easy to mute/turn down what you're listening to and you don't have to physically take anything off your head/ears. But make note of what I said there - you still have to mute/turn down. I read many reviews saying things like ""it just sounds like the music is being played in the background"". Very much not my experience. With podcasts, I could fairly easily understand somebody talking to you from a relatively close distance. With music, no chance whatsoever. It required turning the volume right down in order to to hear them properly. Also if you're a runner like me, you might be thinking these are going to be brilliant for hearing your surroundings, like cars on the road. Again, not the case for me, unless you're listening to a podcast. And if your out on a windy day - forget about it. That just becomes a unpleasant mix of wind and poor quality audio.

BATTERY
=======
This is really good. I charged them once in a week, and on a couple of occasions left them on overnight. I don't doubt the advertisement they can last 10 hours to be honest.

VALUE FOR MONEY
===============
You can probably guess my thoughts here based on the rest of the review. Bone conduction technology is very cool, but for me appears like it's still very immature. £150 for these is just far too much, in my opinion. Yes, they have some conveniences that you just can't get with alternative products in the market, but that's not nearly enough to justify the downfalls - the biggest by far and away is obviously the quality of the sound. That needs to come on leaps and bounds to justify a cost like this. Knowing what I know now, I think they're at least twice as expensive as they should be and probably more than that.

CONCLUSION
===========
Great idea but not for me. Not yet anyway. I have no doubt future versions will improve many times over. To be fair, if you're primarily a podcast listener, I think these are a lot better suited for you. But if you listen to music on a regular basis, I really wouldn't recommend them at all.",2,B09BVXT8TJ,2022,the United Kingdom
R26C1Z8O977UM6,"SHOKZ OpenRun Pro: They're Great, But Not My Cup of Tea (or Tunes)","Hello, fellow audiophiles and gadget geeks! Have you ever met someone who's perfect on paper, but then you meet and there’s just no spark? Well, meet the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro—impressive tech specs, but just not my jam.

 **First Impressions:**
Opening the box, I felt like a kid at Christmas. The SHOKZ OpenRun Pro looked slick, felt sturdy, and promised a sonic revolution with its open-ear bone conduction technology. It’s like having a Tesla for your ears—futuristic, eco-friendly (to your eardrums), and the envy of your jogger friends.

 **Performance Perks:**
Let's be clear: these headphones do exactly what they advertise. They conduct sound through your cheekbones like a sci-fi symphony, leaving your ear canals free to hear the world around you. Great for runners who need to dodge traffic, dogs, or the occasional rogue squirrel. The battery life lasts longer than my motivation to exercise, and they pair with Bluetooth faster than you can say ""sync.""

 **But Here’s the Rub:**
Despite the magic of bone conduction, wearing these felt like being serenaded by a very clingy robot. The sensation of vibrations tickling my temples was more distracting than a mosquito in a sleeping bag. It turns out, I might just be a traditionalist who likes his music delivered the old-fashioned way—through the air, into my ear holes, not via my facial bones.

 **Personal Pet Peeves:**
The open-ear design, while innovative, left me feeling oddly disconnected. It's like being in two places at once: part in your private musical world, part in the harsh reality of noisy streets. Plus, they clung to my head with the desperation of a headband that’s read too many self-help books about never letting go.

🤷 **Conclusion:**
The SHOKZ OpenRun Pro are the headphones of the future, and they perform as promised. But personally, I just didn’t vibe with them. Maybe I'm just set in my ways, or maybe my bones are too traditional to appreciate good vibrations. Two stars because while they are a technological marvel, we just didn't click—like a blind date with a robot who won’t stop talking about quantum physics.

So, if you enjoy cutting-edge tech and don’t mind feeling like your head’s getting a gentle hug from the future, these might be for you. As for me, I’ll stick to the classics. Here’s to old school earbuds and keeping my cheekbones vibration-free!",2,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United States
R3NP46QNXZTWP9,Good Luck Finding the Button on the Left,"When SHOKZ announced the OpenRun Pro - Open-Ear Bluetooth Bone Conduction Sport Headphones, the anticipation was palpable. The prospect of an upgraded auditory experience coupled with the brand's renowned open-ear design promised an exciting evolution in the realm of sport headphones. However, upon diving into the practical use of these headphones, a significant design oversight became apparent, particularly concerning the button on the left side.

Unlike its predecessors, which boasted a tactile feedback system that allowed users to confidently navigate controls without second-guessing, the OpenRun Pro seems to have taken a step back in this department. The button on the left side, crucial for various functions such as power and pairing, presents a real challenge to locate by touch alone. The tactile sensation that once provided immediate feedback has been subdued to a degree that leaves one questioning whether the button has been pressed at all.

This lack of tactile response is more than just a minor inconvenience; it undermines the user experience significantly. For athletes and active users, the ability to quickly and confidently adjust settings on the go is not just a convenience—it's a necessity. The predecessors of the OpenRun Pro excelled in this regard, offering buttons that responded with a satisfying click, allowing users to feel the function as they pressed, even mid-stride or while wearing gloves. This tangible feedback ensured that users could remain focused on their activity without the distraction of fumbling with their headphones.

In contrast, the OpenRun Pro’s button feels almost recessed, requiring a deliberate and forceful press to elicit any response. The sensation—or lack thereof—suggests that the button might be stuck after just one press, leaving users uncertain if their input has been registered. This issue is compounded in environments where quick adjustments are essential, detracting from the otherwise seamless and immersive listening experience that bone conduction technology offers.

While the OpenRun Pro shines in many respects, boasting superior sound quality, comfort, and the innovative open-ear design that allows for situational awareness, the oversight in the tactile design of the control button cannot be overlooked. It's a reminder that sometimes, in the pursuit of innovation, the refinement of fundamental features should not be neglected.

In conclusion, the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro represents a mixed bag of advancements and setbacks. While it pushes the envelope in audio technology and comfort, the regression in user interface design, particularly the left button's tactile feedback, is a significant drawback. It underscores the importance of balancing technological advancements with the practical, everyday needs of users. One can only hope that future iterations will address this oversight, reinstating the tactile satisfaction that once made operating SHOKZ headphones as intuitive as the technology they house.",2,B09BW1BHC3,2024,the United States
R1R1U1ZK42UPOB,Multifunction Doesn’t Work with Audible,"Okay so I’m super bummed, because I actually really love these headphones, but the multifunction button doesn’t work when using Audible and it’s going to end up being a deal breaker I think.

I bought these for two main reasons:
1. I’ve always had issues with having wax build up in my ears and the in ear headphones seem to make it worse.
2. I wear glasses and have found that over the ear headphones press my glasses into the sides of my head and end up hurting.
3. I want to be aware of my surroundings. The way my anxiety is set up, noise cancelling is not my vibe and I always ended up just wearing one in ear bud.

These headphones solved all of those problems.

I would say that if the volume is loud enough noise can be heard by others, but it’s not terrible. And also I don’t think they have much bass. That’s not a dealbreaker for me because I primarily use my headphones for audiobooks, which brings me to my BIG problem:

THE MULTIFUNCTION BUTTON DOESN'T CONTROL AUDIBLE. If I pause it in the app one click will resume playing, but won’t pause, two clicks does actually fast forward 30 seconds, but a triple click doesn’t rewind. I reached out to Shokz via their chat and they told me to connect with Audible. I connected with Audible via there chat and they said that it has nothing to do with them. Sooooo here I am at a loss trying to decide if it’s worth keeping these headphones I love even though I can’t control what I’m listening to with them (**the multifunction button works as expected with Apple Music, the issue is specifically with Audible**).

Anywhoooo, if anyone knows how to correct that it’d be awesome.",2,B09BW1BHC3,2024,the United States
R1UEOFN75HSG66,Sound quality,Sound quality is not up to the mark.,3,B09BW2P5HQ,2023,India
R1NJDV94LVI52Z,"Good as bone conduction gets, but that's not great","I gather that these sound noticeably better than other bone conduction headphones, but those must be worse than mediocre given what I hear with these.  3 stars for mediocre sound, quirky controls, and not great value for the price (~$180 when I bought them, though they are less expensive as of this writing).  On multiple scores for this premium-priced model, I'm afraid Shokz over-promises and under-delivers.  Details follow.

USE CASE (background info, skip ahead to SOUND QUALITY for product comments):  My use case for this was a little unusual - I wanted to listen to music from my phone in a car that lacked Bluetooth or aux-in.  Headphones seemed unsafe, FM xmitter not a reliable option due to lack of open freqs in my area, and upgrading w/an aftermarket stereo isn't worth it for a 10-yr old car that I plan to sell on fairly soon.  I thought bone conduction might be a good solution since it wouldn't block my hearing for traffic sounds, alarms, etc.  I read that sound quality wasn't the main strength of these athletic-oriented headphones, so figured I'd splurge and get the OpenRun Pro since it's consistently rated among the best in this category for sound quality (and I was avoiding the cost of a new car stereo after all).

SOUND QUALITY:  First things first - to my ear the sound quality is perfectly fine for spoken word (audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) but not at all satisfying for music, lacking both bass and high end.  In one sense I'm glad I got these because anything with lower quality would be unacceptable for music and I'm not seeing any models consistently rated higher for sound; on the other hand, judged solely for spoken word, perhaps a less pricey option might have sufficed.  I think these are probably the worst sounding speakers or headphones on which I even try to listen to music (e.g., the affordable little Photive Hydra waterproof BT speaker I keep in my bathroom is much more pleasing).  I've also used these for a few phone calls and they sound great for that.  Folks on the other end seem perfectly happy with mic sound.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:  Shortly after buying this Shokz I got the Oraolo M110 wearable (around the neck) BT speaker, and it worked far better as a  car audio solution than the Shokz, mainly due to superior sound quality (while still leaving ears open to hear the surroundings), for about a third of the cost (though in fairness it eventually had other issues).  If I'd thought to check that out first I'd never have bought the Shokz and saved myself some money; the Oraolo may not hold a candle to proper over-ear headphones, but its sound quality is head and shoulders above the OpenRun Pro.  The Oraolo had some quality problems with its switches that forced me to return it, but a holiday price cut on Sony's premium version of this tech (SRS-NS7) eventually got that to a price (little more than I'd paid for the OpenRun Pro, actually) that I could justify.  Anyway, because I use the neck speakers and the Shokz for similar purposes, I'll mention a few points of comparison in the following comments.

UTILITY:  Despite the above, I do still use the OpenRun Pro with some frequency since I already have them.  They're great for listening to podcasts around the house without disturbing others or while driving, you barely notice you're wearing them (if I've paused the sound to deal with an interruption that goes on longer than expected I can completely forget they're on) - on that score they beat anything else I've owned.  Being worn directly on the head the sound is unaffected by head movements (an issue for neck speakers).  They're not as quiet for folks around you as, e.g., in-ear or over-the-ear headphones, but they're not at all loud in that regard, MUCH quieter than, e.g., neck speakers.

Battery life is usable (at least a few hours), but not nearly the 10 hours they claim.  They certainly don't last as long as other BT headphones and speakers I have, but all this may be understandable given their size and weight.

FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:  Apart from sound quality, this is where I have the most gripes.  Controls are on both left and right sides, with a single multi-function button on the left speaker used for play/pause/answer (1 click), FF (2 clicks), and REW (3 clicks), and a rocker on the right temple controlling power and volume. The problem with this arrangement is that it's so hard to time the 3 clicks for the rewind/skip-back function that it's nearly useless, with the headphones often doing a FF &  pause instead (so of course then you have to REW further...); I usually give up after one try and use my phone or smartwatch.  This would all work much better with a rocker switch in the left temple like the one on the right to control FF/REW, leaving the main button on the left speaker dedicated to play/pause/answer.  Awful design as it stands.

More randomly, the OpenRun Pro sometimes just shuts itself off with an alert tone while in the middle of playing (so not a silence time-out, which they also do) - this seems to happen most often when using it with Roku remote listening, which can be inconvenient.  It does power right back up when you hit the right temple rocker switch .  I've noticed that this issue is addressed in the Shokz OpenRun troubleshooting guide with a recommendation to ""File a warranty claim"", but it doesn't happen all that often apart from the Roku app and recovery isn't that problematic.

OVERALL:  There are some real advantages to this ultra-light non-isolating form factor and I see these are priced below $150 right now, but I'd shop around and check out some reviews for comparable models at lower prices, especially if you'll mainly be listening to podcasts or audiobooks.  For music, I really don't think any of these are likely to be much good given the current state of the art.",3,B09BVXT8TJ,2022,the United States
R38C84ZZPPWB59,Headphones with a side of garbage,"Well first thing first, the headphone sound quality is pretty good. They are very comfortable and can easily be worn all day without any soreness.

That said, this company LOVES their anti-consumer practices. I own a pair of their OpenMove headphones, but the battery life is getting pretty bad after a couple of years of use. The problem is the headphones are completely glued together, there is no way to replace the battery - which is a known wear item. Just because every company glues in their batteries now does not make it okay. It forces you to throw away a perfectly good pair of headphones just because the battery is worn out. I guess they don't care about electronic waste?

Second, the headphones come with a very short (about 24 inches) charging cable. They don't even give you a charging block, just the cable. Yep. Your $180 headphones come with a cable so short, you have to set them on the floor while they charge. Watch your step! Oh, and the cable has a proprietary charging connector, so you can't just grab a longer USB charging cable.

It's a sad state of affairs, but in my experience, Shokz is the best company out there for bone conduction headphones. Their anti-repair and anti-consumer practices show that they care more about taking your money than providing a quality product, but there are simply no other better options out there right now.",3,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United States
R3HJR40DXWVNYI,Not quite as good as expected.,"3 years ago I decided to try the open move by aftershokz headset, which was the cheapest version of this brand at the time. I fell in love with being able to wear these all day without having to remove and keep track of earbuds while I work.

So when I finally broke my aftershokz, I debated between these and the beats powerbeats. I decided pretty quickly to go with these because I thought they would be an even better version of the aftershokz I already liked. This belief turned out to not be quite true.

The good: these are more comfortable than my old ones and they have much better call quality. I always had problems with people hearing me on phone calls with my old pair, but these have no problem at all.

The bad: The sound quality is worse than my old pair. Sound quality is never a strength with bone conducting technology, so I was disappointed to find out these were even worse than a cheaper pair from 3 years ago, but what was an even bigger disappointment was the battery life. My old pair was marketed as an 8 hour battery life while these are marketed as 10 hours, but these dont last nearly as long as my old pair. My estimation is that they die about 1-2 hours before my old pair. And pairing that with the fact that they have a proprietary charger make them even worse. My old pair would usually last the whole time I would be at work, and if they did die, it was a basic USBC charger. These have died all 3 days I have worn them to work, and I'm not carrying the charger because I don't want to loose it and have to order a new one.

In conclusion, the battery life problem is too much of a deal breaker for me, so I am returning these and buying the beats. I would rather carry around a case for the earbuds and get better sound quality than have to take off and charge these in the middle of my work day.",3,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United States
R1Z81NDCHFF0FY,Reviewed vs. Mojawa Run Plus - Mojawa wins,"I compared Mojawa Run Plus with Shokz Openrun Pro (regular and mini) and they both have their strongpoints. My main usage case is road and mountain biking, while also using them around the house (mechanic work, chores, etc). I have a smaller head (55.5CM circumference).

TLDR: The Mojawas win, no contest. They stay on your head way better, don’t move around, have better buttons/controls, and sound about the same. USE THE APP! You can use other sound profiles and the Swim profile is great for non-swim workouts. I returned the Shokz and kept the Mojawas.

The Mojawas sit tight in front and behind your ear and win for fit. This is a BIG win, in my opinion. They really feel planted. They seem to hold in place really well. The band also rides higher around your head, which keeps it from getting caught in your hair. I'm a guy and the Openrun Pro Mini's sometimes got stuck in the short hair behind my head and got irritating, so I ended up with the non-Mini. The Shokz Pro really only hold on the front of the ear and the rest kinda just hangs there . I think this is a big miss on their design. The Mojawas also do better with glasses on than the Shokz, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. The Shokz require more of a sweet spot than the Mojawas did, because of the speakers, and they often fall out of this spot on their own. I can’t imagine running with them on.

The Mojawa wins for control interface, both Volume and the multi-function button. Hands down, no comparison. The Mojawa touch slider for volume gets a little annoying at times, but still less annoying than the tiny Shokz buttons. The Mojawa multi-function button is the entire 'lobe' whereas the Shokz have a tiny little one. The Mojawa sound profiles in the app make a bigger difference than Shokz.
The Shokz win on sound quality, marginally. Having the open speakers that point into your ear makes for a fuller sound. The Mojawas sound good, especially if you use their app and use the Swim sound profile. The Mojawas do have better bass because they hold on your head better. I will note that the Mojawas seemed to vibrate the bones a little more, likely because they are so secured to the head. This didn't bother me after the noticing the initial change. This sound quality difference doesn’t even come close to the benefits of the Mojawa’s improved fit, so it’s a moot point for me.

The sound effectiveness is the same during cycling with winds and whatnot, both are unaffected by wind, both do what they're supposed to do. I did find myself always having a higher volume on the Shokz. After using them for multiple 4hr+ bike rides, I can say I prefer the Mojawa sound profiles overall since I listen to bassier music.

With the Mojawas being IP68 certified, they’re also a better choice for working out in general. The Shokz have open speaker grills and stuff does get in there.

Both brands charge quickly and seem to last about the same amount of time. I always recharged after my 4 hour rides and they were still on “medium” battery.",3,B09BVXT8TJ,2023,the United States
R2AAZBFGTMEB3A,Okay product,I didn’t find its value against price tag. Not that great sound. Cant wear more than 30-40 mins. Its vibration starts giving mild pain after it.

RMC5VPNY3VI6P,Too quiet,"This is my second pair of Shokz I had the titanium version before they worked and sounded great plus they lasted about 2.5 years. I decided to “upgrade” to the pro version and honestly I’m a bit disappointed. The pro version is lighter (which doesn’t matter much at all) has a long life, as for the negatives, the sound quality is insanely quite compared to the titanium, I find myself attempting to turn up the volume mid run/workout only to be disappointed finding out it’s at its max. The only time it sounds good is when I adjust them to being directly over my ears (not connected to the bone anymore). I know the point of bone connection is so that I can hear the outside world as well as my music, but with this pro version I can hear too much outside world and a whisper of music, definitely not worth the price.",3,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United States

R1CH38W9TVW4RN,Put through the wringer,"This is one of my favorite BT headphones I have purchased over the years.  I wore these on a trip for three months through Europe starting in mid September, a few weeks of which were on the Camino from Porto to Santiago in all kinds of weather (during the wet season).  The short review is as follows:

- The battery lasts about 5+ hours of use (phone and preloaded podcasts) and standby time is like fricken days.
- Wearing in the rain seemed to be good and no issues came of being rained on even though many times I was soaked completely.
- The sound was better than I expected.  I would frequently ask people around me if they could hear audio when I was wearing them and was surprised when they said they could not.
- They were comfortable enough that I would forget I was wearing them but if it was hot out they would irritate me at the points of contact.
- Absolutely fixed to my head and would stay in place regardless of my activity.
- No issues trying to connect to any paired devices.
- Sometimes they would have disrupted audio from a phone call if the phone was in a leg pocket and I was walking.  That being said, I would walk 35 feet away, into another room and forget to bring my phone with me during a call and have no problems with the conversation.
- Charging time was so fast.  Never longer than 30 minutes and frequently within 15 minutes for a full charge.
- The magnetic charger is a blessing.  Positive contact every time.

Caveat - If you are looking for the next evolution in audiophile tech, this is not it.  But if you are looking for a stable connection to your audio device that will perform reliably in adverse weather conditions while offering great battery life... Just get it.",4,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,Canada

The headset includes volume up and down buttons to control your device without digging it out of your pocket. Being a bone induction headset, your ears are open to hear what is going on around you, a safety feature you will appreciate out in public or in a working environment.

R3M977SIRSDWK8,"My new favourite headphones, not just for running","I have had all sorts of earphones and have been looking for the ideal running partner. I tried to like the Beats Fit Pro but they kept falling out of my ears. I liked the Musicozy headband but one side stopped working and I didn't like having my head overheat in summer. I ordered the Shokz thinking it was a gimmick and expecting to return it. But for someone who doesn't particularly like having silicone or foam shoved down their ear canals for long periods of time, this is a godsend. The sound is not comparable to real headphones but what they accomplish just through bone conduction is uncanny and perfectly acceptable 90% of the time. Granted, I live in a quiet spot and mainly run in the bush or on quiet trails. If you run in the city, loud cars and trucks and noise might overpower the sound of the device. This is probably why they're mostly known among trail runners. And they've become my number one trail running piece of gear. But another great thing is that you can hear everything normally, so I often keep them on and have conversations while music plays. It doesn't feel like it's in my ears; it feels like it's in the background. This is best with solo piano, classical or jazz. Generally the more over-produced songs with lots of layers don't sound so great. But sometimes, depending on the mastering, complex sounds sound great. When it comes to spoken media, podcasts, audiobooks, it's all good. There's a vocal booster which sometimes helps but usually I stay in standard mode. I would wear these all day if I didn't have to charge them sometimes. They charge very fast. The USB charger is good but they should upgrade to type C, and make the case so you can charge while in the case. Apart from that I love everything about them, the physical buttons, the overall quality, and I find myself using them in all occasions including falling to sleep with a Headspace sleepcast (lying on the side, otherwise it's not ideal). The band doesn't touch the back of my head, which makes me wonder if I should have gotten the small version, although it's probably good that it doesn't touch. In any case it never falls off or moves despite running for 10 km non stop. Thank you Shokz for making these! Worth every cent.",5,B09BW2P5HQ,2023,Australia
RR7R25910W1RD,Very poor sound quality,"I've had these headphones for about 1 year now and I honestly don't know why I didn't return them. First off the sound quality is awful, for $230 I was expecting it to be quite a bit better. $230 is not super expensive for headphones especially if they have decent sound but the sound quality from these headphones is in the $50 range. The battery does not last long either. Normally with good headphones you can leave them turned on and as long as they are idol and not using much power the battery will not drain quickly. That's not the case with shockz, when they are ""ON"" they will drain power at a steady rate in my experience. You should not have to turn off the headphones in between calls to save significant power. The reason I'm leaving this review so late is because I bought my wife a pair of Oladance OWS1 Open Ear
Headphones from Amazon and they are so much better by a long shot, much cheaper too ! So I thought I would let everyone know :) After I tried the Oladance set for my wife I was actually quite annoyed that I bought these Shockz and they are absolutely unacceptable sound quality for $230. I have no idea why these headphones received a whopping 4.5 stars,  like come on guys. I guess my standard of sound quality is much higher. I think my review is more then accurate so if you value sound quality then run away from these. I did leave a 1 star and it's not because I could not leave a zero but because they are fine for something like a pod cast or YouTube occasionally... But that's it..",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,Canada
R1JK0JUJ7S7C79,Poor Bluerooth - Very Disappointing,"In many ways I am very happy with the headphones but after having used them for a while I must conclude that the bluetooth doesn’t work the way you should expect for a product of this price.
There is a delay between the sound starts on the phone before the headphones gives any response. Maybe 1-2 seconds. This means you lose the first seconds of the sound. This makes them useless for talking on the phone or listen to something where there is a pause in the sound, like for example listening to a language course or an audio book. The sound becomes very staccato and broken in the beginning. Once the sound has started it’s ok as long as the sound doesn’t stop, like music.
Since I use the headphones to much more than listening to music they are a big disappointment I am sorry to say and I find my self using my normal headphones again and also I am looking for other models.",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,Spain
RTRFJJTE6TZWE,"Bad for long hair or with glasses. Feels like a hoax, sound is directed at tragus.","Maybe this works with some people, but these worked so poorly with me that I feel like it's just a lame hoax. They were so uncomfortable, i could not for the life of me get these on. I have both long thick hair and wear glasses.

I tied up my hair but then it has to be tied up just perfect to avoid moving the cord in the back. When moving, there is no way to keep this from happening unless I has like cemented my hair down with product which is just not reasonable to do everytime I want to wear these. No headband in the world is going to be enough.

I also wear glasses, these curve around my ear in a way that it messes with my glasses. They also are so incredibly noticeable that it was distracting and got sore after a while.

It feels like hoax because it just doesn't feel like the sound is doing anything special other then being super loud and directed in a way that the sound can pierce through the tragus and the sound just enters your ear canal anyways.

If i put ear plugs in, it absolutely feels muffled which really just leads me to believe that these arnt 'vibrating through the cheekbones' like claimed. It's just loud directed noise that is using the ear canal just muffled by the tragus.

Anyways this is jus a disaster for me. I tried both the mini and standard and had issues with both.

Mini was too tiny and the standard is to large.

There's a noticeable increase in quality and bass, but it's not a huge amount of difference compared to the airs. They're also more comfortable, and have an extra 4 hours of runtime.

Docked four stars for the move away from a USB input to a proprietary magnetic charger. Lose the cable or forget to bring it with you on a trip, and you're out of luck. I hate proprietary charging systems. The Trekz airs' had a micro-usb charge port with a cover and held the same IP55 rating. I'd take a compromise of lower battery in exchange for having a USB-C port. I also miss the forest green color.

Just went on a cruise and brought these with me. Grabbed a couple usb-c cables and a couple micro type b cables and went on my way. Guess what I didn't bring? This dumb proprietary charger. So after day one, I was without headphones.",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2024,the United States

I got these and the OpenRun Mini's. The pro's fit me better. I have a big head and fairly thick neck. The mini's still fit but were pulling on the top of my ears a bit and became uncomfortable over time.

Pros:
1. You can hear everything around you while listening to music or having calls.
2. They are comfortable and stay put.
3. Audio quality is not as good as earbuds or over the ear headphones but impressive for what it is.
4. They are water resistant.
5. They have multipoint and supports multiple devices being connected at the same time.
6. They have a mute feature where you can mute the mic on the headphones themselves instead of the phone or computer, however the feature is ruined by constant beeping while muted.

Cons:
1. Auto mutes the headphones after a video call starts. You have you unmute by pressing the vol+ and vol- buttons at the same time. Sometimes it auto mutes again. There is no way to turn this feature off.
2. When muted on the headphones, they beep the whole time you are muted. Why? Who thought this was necessary and a good idea? There is no way to disable this.
3. When multipoint is enabled and 2 devices are connected, if one device disconnects the headphones beep continuously for the next 5 minutes. Why? Who thought this was necessary and a good idea? There is no way to disable this.
4. Multipoint is not enabled by default. There is no reason for it not to be enabled by default.

R3ET0VHAGCEATP,Defective Thrice.,"My very first AfterShokz was awesome. Nothing was wrong with it. Loved the simplicity of wearing it while working out and atill being able to hear my surroundings. The only thing was that it physically broke 2 yrs later when I dropped it and my dog happened to step on it causing the left ear side to dangle.

This version has a defect though— the PAUSE BUTTON does not work. The replacement I received also does not work (it worked at first for about 2 days before it too, stopped). I continued to use it for a couple weeks hoping the button would miraculously start working so I wouldn’t have to return this one as well. 

For $200 the company should make sure everything actually works before blindly selling them. What a pain. I don’t want a repeat experience but hopefully my 3rd time will be a charm… 🤞 If it is, I’ll be back to update my rating and this review.

—UPDATE—
Unfortunately I won’t be adding stars even though for my 3rd try I ended up purchasing the regular OpenRun model (non “Pro”). It too has a defective pause button. It just does not want to work for YT. I checked my old red (After)Shokz pair that dangles but still works and yes the pause button works for YT podcasts. Perhaps it’s a defect for all black colored headphones…? Sadly, I think I may be done with this company.",1,B09BVXT8TJ,2023,the United States

1. Doesn't work that way, when you work in a noisy environment. You have to turn the volume up so much that when ppl try to talk to you you have to remove them off ur ears... FAIL.

2. Sometimes gives me headaches. With the vibrations of the music going through the bone infront of the  ear. It's difficult to explain, its like a migraine hits in an instant and out of nowhere. Then the rest of that day is shot.... FAIL.

3. Proprietary charger. I thought it was pretty cool to have a Proprietary charger. I thought they had created something really good magnet 🧲 I pictures something like the apple Mac book.
Well it is magnetic,  which means with the polarity the charger only connects 1 way. And it seemed to make a good connection.  I have ad it now for about 6 mon. Well 1 side of the charger broke.... or fell off, the glued a small pc of metal to plastic I'm guessing that metal was 1 of the magnets 🧲  now with out that it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CHARGE. & I dont know where or when i lost that pc so i cant even try to glue it back on. It now charges for day because it can't get the proper connection it needs. The last time I tried to charge it I taped the charger to the device.

R14RGOAW9N8MCX,A catastrophic downgrade from the previous model,"I am an Olympic-level distance runner. I run 100+ miles a week, 12-15 miles in a single session twice a day almost everyday, and have been doing so for years. I have extensive experience with all kinds of high-end headphones, including sets typically marketed towards athletes like Bose and Jaybird. The previous model for this headset (""Aftershokz Trekz Air) is the only pair of headphones I was never able to obliterate through sweat and activity. Bose failed in three months, then failed again in three months after replacement. Jaybirds lasted about 7 before needing replacement, and then failed again. The primary problem was that I hemorrhage water (I'm as wet as if I jumped into a pool on particularly hot/humid days), and the water/salts would sluice down the headphones/wiring and infiltrate the charging ports, leading to water damage and corrosion of the electronics.

The previous model has a seal on the charging port, which is positioned on the underside of the headset directly behind the ear. The placement, seal, and lack of wires, prevented sweat from entering the charging port. I got my first pair of the old model December 2019 - it still works, although one ear has become tinny (likely my fault through dropping the headset many times over the years). I bought two extra pairs of the old model that worked perfectly, but which I unfortunately lost. I bought a used pair off eBay earlier this year that lasted about 4 months until they started having connectivity issues, which is a risk you take with refurbished electronics.

This new model didn't even last as long as the refurbished old model: it failed in a month. The power button became inoperable. The headset could not be turned off and volume could not be raised. I did not want to buy this new model because I noticed design changes I thought would cause problems, but the old model has become increasingly difficult to find new-in-box, and consequently its price has become extremely inflated. I decided to try this model and immediately/within a week had these issues to note:

- The charging port is not sealed microUSB; it is a magnetic contact charger exclusive to this brand of headphone. So, 1) the charging apparatus is constantly exposed to any sweat or liquid, and the way it is depressed into the headset and placed farther away from the ear causes sweat to collect in it. The water resistance rating of the headset (which I checked before purchase) is irrelevant: if you train for hours seriously, and sweat excessively, sweat WILL collect there and IS likely to damage the charger. I know this from experience with other headsets. 2) You can't use any microUSB charger you have lying around to charge it, which is annoyingly inconvenient.

- The control buttons are significantly smaller vs the old model, and the placement more cramped behind the ear, which makes adjusting volume while running incredibly difficult.

- The headband is actually tighter than the old model's, despite being the same size, because the ear loops tilt outward, and then the ear buds twist acutely inwards. This puts pressure on the shell of the ear and area directly behind your temple, and I noticed that I would get headaches and bruising/tenderness of those areas while wearing. The old model did not have this weird subtle twisting design, but was just as secure and I never had any issues with them falling off or bouncing. I have an average-sized head.

- Small but still noteable downgrades: no earplugs provided like with old model; the case they provide is lower quality and not waterproof (drawstring raincoat fabric vs old full-zip rubber/silicone)

Overall, I do not recommend this headset for serious athletes. It might be fine for more casual exercise, but even then I wouldn't recommend buying a product that is just as expensive as but also worse than its previous iteration. This is such a huge, inexplicable downgrade from the old model, which is, demonstrably, the best headset I've ever used. Again, these failed sooner than any of the other high-end sports headsets I've used. The design changes don't seem to add anything to this model, so why make them? I'm selling the replacement the company sent and just buying another old pair. Actually incredulous.

Update: it took Shokz two months to replace my headset. It was a huge hassle and the company would have ignored the issue if I hadn't followed up with them several times. They even tried to close my replacement ticket because they hadn't heard from ME about the status of my replacement.",1,B09BVYKTZM,2023,the United States
R1F98T9M3GUUJ,Updated:  batteries continue to die in six months.  Downgraded to one star,"These head conduction headsets are great.  Good sound quality, and since nothing in the year you can hear others in the room or, if you are a runner, a vehicle coming up behind you.  BUT:  my fourth set in three years just died, as the others did.  Work great, until the battery will not take a charge, then they are totally dead, no amount of charging will bring it back.  Like most people I don't keep every little piece of paper for everything I buy to enforce the warranty, but I'm going to try to get to the manufacturer via Amazon and see if they will do the right thing.  If I have to buy a new set, I'm going searching for a different brand.  More information when I have it.

Two weeks later:  I suppose after reading my review, Shokz sent me two (2!) new headsets in response to my comment that I had had more than one battery die early.  I stand by my earlier statement that the unit performs well.  Great sound and the bone conduction concept is a solid one.  Good fidelity and you really can hear people around you.  They do look a bit goofy, and others often think they are hearing aids (I'm older than most trees) so I tell them the Mother Ship is parked behind the moon and these are how I get my instructions.

But wait, there's more!  Started using one of the two headsets Shokz sent me three weeks ago. Three weeks.  And the battery on it will not take a charge.  Charged all night, the ""charging"" light was on, but this morning the unit will not turn on at all.  They need to buy batteries from someone else, or get somebody that knows what they are doing to redesign their charger circuit.

Added:  Now I give up.  Altogether I have had six units counting the ones I bought and the ones they replaced.  I got an email a month ago they were sending me another one: not here yet.  I just threw away the last one, which lasted six month.  I am very familiar with electronics, especially consumer level.  The problem here is one of several possibilities:  1) cheap batteries, 2) poor charger design, 3) contamination in the battery material, 4) failure for the charger to stop when full, thus cooking the battery.  I read in another review they say to no charge more than two hours.  That's just silly; easy to have a timer that shuts charging down after some period of time.  I have offered to return all of my units so their engineering folk could do failure analysis; no interest.

So if you want these, and they are great when they are not dead, get a subscription for a new pair every sis months.",1,B09BW1QVVT,2023,the United States
R3FZN9Z8RERPA,Extremely Disappointing,"I purchased these Shokz headphones after a previous pair of Shokz (which I reviewed before) had lost sound in one ear. It was outside of warranty replacement, so I decided to upgrade to the OpenRun. I purchased these in November 2022, and they worked flawlessly for a period of about 6 months. In May of 2023, the power on button appeared to have failed, as they would not power on, even after a full charge.

Previously, I had a fantastic experience getting a warranty replacement for my previous pair of Shokz. I filed a claim online, provided my receipt, and within a day or two, the warranty was approved, and I was sent a brand new pair of headphones in the mail; I did not have to return my headphones. To put it simply, it could not have been easier, and I was happy with my experience.

I expected to have the same experience when filing my warranty replacement for these headphones. I went online, filed a claim, only this time, I had to wait for the approval and a separate return shipping label to return my headphones before Shokz would send me a new replacement under warranty. I waited a few days for the shipping label to arrive; after about a week with no return shipping label, I reached out to Shokz customer support to see if I had somehow missed it. After many emails back and forth and over a month after the initial warranty claim, I finally received the shipping label and sent my headphones back for a warranty replacement. I received the new pair, and thought this was settled.

Now, just over a month after receiving my warranty replacement pair of Shokz, the same issue is occurring again (the power button fails to turn on the unit). After the last hassle of having to be without my headphones for over a month, I'm not sure it's worth yet another inconvenience to get another warranty replacement.

It seems that Shokz's customer service has taken a nosedive since my last experience. I would recommend that, if you are looking to buy a quality set of bone conduction headphones, that you stay away from the Shokz brand, or at least from this specific set of headphones in particular. The same issue happening on two separate sets of the same headphones makes me feel that Shokz team is aware of this product issue, but are dragging their feet on providing warranty service, and are continuing to sell these with this known issue.

Music quality is very bad. Simple pop music is tolerable to listen to, but I tried Everlong by Foo Fighters and it was terrible. Bass is almost completely missing and the rest of the sound is very muddy and undefined. However this could also be because of my face. I'm quite overweight and have probably a thicker layer of fat between the device and the bone it's supposed to conduct to. The way it is for me though, I'd rather not listen to music at all than like this.

For listening to an audio book the quality is actually really good. Voices come through really well and it's very easy to follow the story while also still hearing things around you. However now the device falls on its face in a different way, the controls. When listening to a book I frequently want to jump back a bit if I missed something. To do that you have to press the multifunction button 3 times, but you only get a very short window to do this in. I have to try to press three times as fast as I can to get it to register. If I'm not fast enough, it jumps forward and then maybe pauses. I was just on a walk with it and tried to go back a bit but just wasn't getting it to cooperate at all. In the end I took out my phone to find my place in the story again and it turns out the device had jumped forward like 10 times or so. Also, if you double press while paused the device dials the last called number... So if you get the timing wrong, instead of jumping back, you pause and start calling. I accidentally called a friend three times already in the short time I tested this thing. I really don't understand how something like this made it out of testing, it's truly awful.

All in all, if you are skinny and/or don't care about the music quality and you just want to let the music play without doing more than pausing or playing, then maybe it could be okay. For my experience though, I feel I'm being generous giving 2 stars. Sending back for a refund.",2,B09BW1T7X2,2022,the Netherlands
R3MBXGVQPE2Y1N,Not worth the money anymore,"I have used Shokz headphones since before the company renamed itself Shokz from Afershokz. My original pair of Aftershokz had an ear pad come off after 2 years of use. The warranty took care of them, and they sent a new pair, now branded Shokz. The replacement pair lasted just under 2 years and stopped working completely. After almost 4 years of use with the original design, I upgraded to the open run in July 2023. They now have an exposed charging port no longer covered, and the buttons are a tad different, no biggie, so I thought. I use these for marathon training, so they get used a lot in a running environment. I started having issues with my charger not wanting to charge, even though I cleaned the ports off before charging. Now, 6 months into owning these, the power button and selection button have stopped working completely. They still connect via Bluetooth, and the volume down button still works, but I can't turn them off or use the selection button anymore. For something that is supposedly designed for running and costs almost $150 it should last a lot longer than 6 months. They do have a 2 year warranty, but why buy something you are going to have issues with so quickly? If i have to send these in every 6 months to be replaced and have to spend weeks with out them because of this, what's the point? Buyer beware",2,B09BVYKTZM,2024,the United States
RMERCWF9APGJL,Microphone failed on all 3 pairs.,"I bought my first pair of these many years ago. I like the concept and the sound is OK for what it is, but the microphone failed early on and they eventually stopped charging. I bought a second pair in March 23 and the microphone failed after a couple of months. I did a warranty return and got a fresh pair, and again the microphone failed after a few months. I tried to do a warranty return on those and the company ignored me.
Yes, I tried all the troubleshooting steps for the microphone that they suggest. Many times. That fact that they even have those microphone troubleshooting steps combined with my experience of 3 failed units in a row tells me that they know their microphone has problems but they aren't bothering to fix it.
You DEFINITELY don't get what you pay for in this case. They are WAY too expensive for subpar audio and a microphone that fails. I think I'm being generous with 2 stars. If the microphone would stay working then I would like these a lot more, but having to disconnect bluetooth to answer calls because you won't be heard by the caller is a total pain. Look elsewhere.",2,B09BW1QVVT,2024,the United States
R2LKDS4ZQUOTA2,Interesting concept. Did not live up to the hype.,"So the sound quality isn't bad. And they work surprisingly well and they paired easily with my phone. I have a few coworkers that really love these and I have a hard time finding ear buds that fit comfortably in my ears. I figured why not try them out. I don't have much nice to say beyond that.

These don't always sit where I try setting them, when they move the sound quality definitely varies, and the band that goes across the back of my head feels like it gets in the way a lot. And the button connections that are supposed to work with my phone are super laggy which can be frustrating when I'm trying to quickly pause what I'm listening to when people try to engage in conversation with me. I'm pretty sensitive to sounds and these do not have great volume control options, and the default sounds such as when I get a phone call or trying to adjust the settings using the headphone buttons are crazy loud compared to the normal volume I listen to things at. Seriously getting a phone call while wearing these makes my head feel like it's ringing like a bell. I keep trying to love these the way my co-workers obviously do, and I have yet to find a situation where I think they are superior to my ear buds and it's been over a month and everytime the phone rings though these, I dislike them just a little bit more. My ear buds are by no means perfect, but the controls are easier to operate and I don't feel like I'm vibrating out of the current plane of existence every time I get a phone call. If you're sensitive to sounds or vibrations, you might be better served looking into other options.",2,B09BVYKTZM,2023,the United States
R378I70RUX9K7U,Broke after less than 5 months,"Sound is ok, nothing to write about, perfect for voice, music is bad, but it's the technology not the product. They broke after less than 5 months, after 3 months I couldn't do any calls as my voice wouldn't come through the microphone. The worst part is when I want to claim warranty their warranty page is empty. I thought I'll buy another pair, but I paid £80 something for them, and now they are £129, not worth it.",2,B09BW1T7X2,2024,the United Kingdom
R22LKY7XGJXE2V,Vibration and buzzing is very jarring and uncomfortable,"I bought these SHOKZ open ear bone conduction headphones for cycling.  They do allow you to hear the outside world, which is what the purpose of these headphones are. They sound ok for audiobooks and podcasts but terrible for music.  But that's not the worst part.  The worst part is that they vibrate  like crazy against your side of your head when the voice or music hits a certain frequency.  It feels very uncomfortable to the point where I'd rather just have headphones that don't allow me to hear the outside world as much.

Luckily there are other options for open ear headphones ideal for cycling.  I stumbled upon a brand called Oladance and ordered the OWS 2 headphones.  They sound much better than the SHOKZ Openrun in terms of sound quality (although still not as good as high end earbuds from say Bose or Sennheiser), but the Oladance also let you hear the outside world because they don't cover up your entire ear canal.

I do give the SHOKZ an extra star because they wrap around the back of your neck, reducing the chance of just losing one of the earbuds as is possible with regular earbuds or the Oladance OWS 2, but as of this writing (Jan 2024) I saw that Oladance is coming out with a Sports version that will wrap around the neck and be completely waterproof.  I might have to grab a pair of those eventually if falling off becomes a problem for the OWS 2's.",2,B09BVYBS4J,2024,the United States
RNRNJTSNPCHD0,"works well, except batteries die quickly","Good: I like the sound quality of the Shokz Open Run , the bone conduction aspect sure helps my old ringing ears hear music better, and the fact that it stays on my head without falling off, without requiring the typical ear buds being in my ears and constantly falling out.
Not so good: The different audio modes don't offer much differences in clarity, and I would like to have the option of amplifying conversations in order to hear them better. And there is no noise cancellation, but that's expected with the open ear design.
Bad:  Every time I want to use it,  have to charge it first even though it was just charged the day before. The battery life is really unacceptable. I have other non-bone conduction headsets that I can use for a week or more without charging. This unit needs daily charging! It is too late to return it so I'll submit a warranty claim, but their web site process is really cumbersome.",2,B09BW1QVVT,2024,the United States
R90TEWAMB65P1,"OpenRun vs OpenMove, just get the OpenMove","Update after using for 6+ months: with extended use my opinion of these has fallen even farther, the sound quality is a bit worse then then my old cheaper OpenMove, and one side of these has started to rattle a bit when producing certain sounds and they are a bit less comfortable. I still mainly use my old OpenMoves and just go to these when the battery is dead on those or when I want something that I can use in the shower. I used my old OpenMoves in the shower for a couple of years with no issues, but now the charging port cover has fallen off of them and some of the plastic is flaking off on one side of the casing so they are not water resistant anymore. Really the only reason I could think of to get these over the OpenMove is if you want something that could be used while swimming, these are very waterproof.

Original reveiw:
The OpenRun is a good headest that is slightly better the the OpenMove in a couple of ways, but they sound pretty much exactly the same, and the comfort level is basically the same, so I do not think that the OpenRun justifies it's higher price.

The only difference that I consider possibly significant is that the fit of the OpenRun allows it to function better when laying down. The OpenMove loses contact with the sides of my face when laying down so it basically does not function while the OpenRun works laying down it is just a bit uncomfortable.

The sound between the OpenRun and the OpenMove is incredibly similar, so similar that I expect that they used the exact same drivers in both

The OpenRun has a magnetic charging cable, which is nice, but the OpenMove uses USB C so it does not have to have a special cable and can be charged with anything so I consider that a wash.

The OpenRun has faster charging I think, but they both charge pretty quick and I do not really care as I just charge them at night anyway, they both last all day so charging speed does not really matter.

The OpenRun has better water resistance, probably mostly due to the magnetic charging, but I do not really care about that.

The OpenRun fits differently then the OpenMove but I find the comfort level to be basically the same on both, it is kind of nice to have 2 different ones, so that if I one starts to irritate a spot on my ears I can switch to the other.

The OpenRun fits slightly closer to the head and looks a bit nicer the the OpenMove perhaps? But I do not really care about that

The Bluetooth connection range and quality seems exactly the same, about 20 feet on both in a house with a couple of walls in between when connected to my Laptop with a Intel Bluetooth chip. They both do a bit better with my Pixel 5 about 30 feet.

Strangely every time a new source of audio starts playing the OpenRun kind of does a little blep of the sound then cuts out and back in, the OpenMove does not do this. This is not a big deal but I prefer the way the OpenMove handles this better, note that my OpenMoves are from over 2 years ago, so it is possible that the newer OpenMoves also have this issue.

Battery life is hard to compare as my OpenMoves have been hard used for 2 years so the battery has degraded some, I have not really timed them, but the new OpenRun is better. One thing I will say is that I am really impressed with the quality of the batteries that Shokz uses. My 6 year old? Aftershokz Titanium headphones will still run for 6+ hours even after what must have been at least 2-3 thousand cycles by now. I have been using my OpenMoves for 8-12 hours a day, charging them every day for over 2 years now and they will still run for 10+ hours, so the batteries in these things seem really solid, better then what they put in most smartphones.

I have been using aftershokz headphones several years now now, my first one was a Aftershokz Titanium, then I got the OpenMove a couple of years ago and it was a massive improvement over the Titanium in basically every way. a few weeks ago when they where on sale for $100 I bought a OpenRun hoping that it would be an improvement over the OpenMove, but apparently they have not advanced at all in the last couple of years even when moving up a tier, the sound and the comfort is the same. I kept the OpenRuns because it was nice to have a second one to swap out when the battery runs dead on one, but I consider them both basically interchangeable. I really cannot tell which one I am wearing most of the time. So although the OpenRun is good the OpenMove is basically the same but cheaper making it a much better value.",3,B09BVYBS4J,2023,the United States
RL49JQUIKKEXY,Their okay,"Pros:
-Their lite around the ears and neck
- They allow you to hear around your surroundings

Cons:
- The charging cable is short.
- The charging cable is not usb-c, which makes it hard to charge.
- You'll have to buy more cables so you can charge the headset if you move from one vehicle to another.
- Extra cables cost a lot.
- If you wear them around your neck when not in use, it can be irritating. Even around your head. Can be annoying at times.
- There's no case for them to place when not in use.
- THESE BLUETOOTH ARE TO EXPENSIVE... THEY SHOULD COST ABOUT $40.00 DOLLARS. NOT WORTH $129.00.

I'VE HAD MINE FOR ABOUT 8 MONTHS. I go back to my old ones more often because I haven't bought extra charging cables to put in my vehicles. So when the battery dies, I have to wait to charge them and remember to keep my cable close, but when I use them.",3,B09BW1QVVT,2024,the United States

Amazon, nor anyone else, should not be stating 8hrs battery life.",3,B09BW1T7X2,2024,the United Kingdom
R1QM33AYHZZSAR,"Sounds good, not the best for phone calls.  Supports only a single connection.","Overall, I like this headset - but it's not my favorite.
Pros
1) The sound is good ""stereo sound"".
2) Open ears for me is a plus.  I don't like things in my ears, and having my ears covered all day with over ear headphones is not comfortable.
3) Basically, just said it, but these are comfortable to wear in most situations and cause no problems with glasses.
4) I have not thoroughly tested the durability - but they hold up just fine and spring back to shape if bent around.

Cons
1) Single device support.  I cannot have these connected to both my computer and phone at the same time.  Each time you change between the phone and computer you need to put the headset into pairing mode.  (This is the reason I wanted to write this review - it's extremely disappointing that a $100+ headset does not support multiple devices).  I can see the device available on my computer & phone but pressing connect on the phone or computer does not automatically transfer the device.  It needs to be in pairing mode before pressing connect.
2) There is no mute button on the headset.
3) There is a button on the side, that if you bump will hang up/disconnect your call.  This is a problem if you have long hair, and you are trying to pull your hair out from underneath the headset.  Would be great if this button could be used as a mute button.
4) While its comfortable to wear in most situations, because of the hard head band, you cannot comfortably lay your head back in a recliner, car, bed/pillow etc...  Anything that touches the band, moves the headphones from your ears.

And this last point is both a pro and a con depending on your view: Your ears are not covered so you can typically hear everything going on around you.  I like it, but in some situations, its not ideal.",3,B09BW1QVVT,2024,the United States
R2IVGC36DFJOQW,Great for running - but limited in bluetooth pairings,"I bought these headphones to use while running, so that I could avoid blocking my ears with earbuds or over-ear headphones and maintain awareness of other vehicles when on the roads.  Earbuds also caused wax impaction and blocked my ear one time, so avoiding that is another benefit of these.

They're extremely lightweight and once you get use to the slight pressure of the transducers in front of your ears, you can almost not feel them at all.  They don't bounce at all with running strides.

The audio quality is reasonable but not as good as ear phones that transmit sound into your ear canals.  I think there will always be some losses when conducting sound vibration through skin and cheekbones.

Battery life seems quite good.  I can go for many ~40 minute runs on a single charge before they start verbally warning me of ""battery low"" when I power them on.

My only real complaint with these headphones is that they are limited in the number of devices they can pair with.  They have a function they call ""multipoint pairing"", which allows a maximum of two devices to be paired simultaneously (but not listened to simultaneously).  If you switch the headphones on while in range of both paired devices and it connects to both, if you then move out of range of one of the devices, the headphones will start sounding warning beeps roughly every 10 seconds until you power them off and on again.

Also, while watching a movie on my tablet a few days ago, my phone briefly cut in with a notification sound, then afterwards the audio from the tablet was very choppy and didn't recover until I powered the headphones off and back on again.",3,B09BW1QVVT,2023,the United Kingdom
R2MPER6VDQ3EEQ,I love/hate these headphones!,"I purchased this set of headphones primarily to solve an issue I have always had whereby people seem to struggle to hear me when I use conventional headsets like the Jabra Evolve 65. In that respect, this product gets full marks because so far everyone I have spoken to on the Shokz says they can hear me clearly. The design and look are fine from the front and I have no complaints. Obviously, these are designed for the highly active user, and I can see them being practical for the jogger, cyclist and so on. For that use case, they are perfect but mine is more of a mundane listening to music as I go about the day. I’m unlikely to need water-repellent features unless I get caught in a shower.
Aside from the positive, I unfortunately have a few thoughts about things that I found somewhat annoying about this set of headphones. Firstly, the sound quality is just about acceptable. They are no match for my entry level Sennheiser in-ear headphones so I have to carry both, depending on whether I need to play music or make calls. In particular, the bass response is poor, but this could be just down to my incorrect assumption that they would thump against my bones and produce deeper bass than they actually do.
 As for performance in traffic or noisy surroundings, they are barely usable. I suppose in-ear phones have an advantage in that they block out ambient noise with the buds. This is a personal thing as it can equally be argued that these are specifically designed to allow open ear usage. I just find the trade-off too much.
The next annoyance is the loud beep that is produced every time the control buttons are pressed. When listening at low volume, the beep is quite jarring.  I also got a rather startling vibration when I received an incoming call, but I’m not sure whether this was a one-off.
The last but most annoying feature of the headphones is the design of the bit of “titanium” that connects the two sides. I totally understand all the challenges the designers had to overcome to arrive at a product that stays in place through active use. I also appreciate the difficulty in trying to make a product that fits every size and shape of head; wigs, afros, bald, take your pick. Lastly, I realise that with controls on both sides of the head there had to be a robust wiring solution, and that doesn’t lend itself to an adjustable band. So, with all that in mind, I still think the shape of the band is totally impractical for anything other than for use when out and about. I already tried and there’s no way you are going to be able to use these on a train, plane or lying on your bed, unless on your side. You might just be able to get away with it if your height is such that the band goes into the gap between the backrest and headrest! I am sure there must be a way to overcome the weird jutting out from behind the head, which while functional is a big no for me.
In summary, I feel like this is a good product that will certainly serve well the sporty types or those who find in/over-ear headphones unsuitable, but falls short as a replacement for conventional headsets of the same price bracket. I haven’t yet tested the battery life as I simply can’t see myself having these on all day.",3,B09BW1QVVT,2022,the United Kingdom

Also my ear was getting sore as I kept jamming them in trying to make them stay put.  Shokz has finally solved that problem for me by not being in my ears at all! I was a little dubious about this new innovation until I tried them. The sound quality is much better than I thought it would be and the controls are much easier to use than my Senheisers are.  I found the mini Shokz fit better for me so I gave my husband my original set and he bought me the mini version.  The sound is not great in noisy places like the subway but work well walking on the street and I like the fact that you can hear what’s going on around you; which makes me feel a bit safer. The battery life is comparable to that of Bose or Senheiser products. The fact that they are joined with a solid band makes them less convenient to pack away than a pair of ear buds but it’s not a deal breaker for me.

So unless you want to set timers and alarms to charge these in a way they are not completely ruined, don’t buy them. Had I known this about these headphones, I would not have purchased them.

Editing this to add: I have had to replace 3 pairs of these since I purchased them approximately 6 weeks ago.  I can’t seem to get a pair that has more than 2 hours of battery life

Additional edit as of March 2023- I have no idea how many pairs shokz has replaced at this point (maybe 6?) because I can’t get more than 2ish hours of battery life.  Finally today I received an email from their customer service with this direct quote in it
“ The data gathered for the battery life at the Shokz laboratory is tested by playing ACC-encoded audio at 75% volume on iOS14 mobile devices. The actual battery life will be affected by the type of audio, volume, temperature of your environment, and output of the USB port used to charge your headphones.

This means it lasts for ""up to 8 hours"" but it doesn't mean that it will last the full 8 hours all the time. if at full volume it is expected to last around 2-3 hours while the Pros can last around 4-5 on average. ”

RAZRGQ067R27R,Did not fit. “Standard” size is WAY too big,"I’ve seen people walking around with these around the back of their head and I’m thinking, “man, that’s awesome, you can barely see them”. So I thought they would be perfect for work. So I bought the “standard” size thinking I surely have a “standard” size adult head. But what I’m finding out is everyone that has been walking around with them neatly snugged against the back of their head, not sticking out, protruding or getting caught on collars has the MINI size. Why in the world is the MINI size not the “standard” size. And the “standard” size should be called an “extra large” size. I was lead to believe the “mini” for was children because who else has a miniature head? I have no idea who the “standard” size is meant for but it’s clearly not an adult human. Other people I have talked to have made the same mistake as I have and are upset to have wasted $130. We were unable to return the product because we did not find out what the problem was until it was too late. I will rate this 1 star for fit and failure to accurately market size.

R958F14YZYYHA,"Stopped working after 2 weeks, lousy service","The design and sound are inferior compared to other versions of those headphones. After 2 weeks, the right bone transmitter gave up, the worst I have experienced. Service centre not helpful too.",1,B09BVX8ZXF,2024,Singapore
R2021FHBHOJHW6,Two pairs broke within 9 months,"I was really excited about getting Shokz headphones because, as a runner, they seemed to be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, in my personal experience, the product was much better in theory than in practice. I bought my first pair in April 23 and they broke (manufacturer fault as opposed to user fault) in October. The customer service provided to me was non existent; a cursory email telling me the warranty ts and cs, but no apology or empathy. I ended up contacting Amazon directly about this issue and they were great and refunded me the money in full - not Shokz, whom I brought the product from in the first place. I received a replacement pair in October and this has now broken too within 6 months. Again, the fault was the product; I went to turn on the headphones and nothing happened.  Dead as a dodo. I contacted Shokz who again had ZERO interest in providing any assistance,  or in offering an apology. They simply said I had already received a replacement product under my warranty and I was not entitled to a replacement pair as a result. So, tough luck basically. Again, as I was not very happy with this response, I contacted Amazon directly and they were very helpful as always, even though they were not the direct vendor. I now need to return the product to Amazon who will issue a refund since Shokz were worse than useless at helping. While I loved the headphones when they worked, there is clearly an issue with the quality (as well as the customer service)since two pairs broke within 9 months of purchasing. For this reason, I won't buy another Shokz product and honestly couldn't recommend them to others based on my experience.",1,B09BVX8ZXF,2024,the United Kingdom
RMX8HUL73BO5O,NOT bone conducting technology! (Also useless),"These definitely are not bone conducting tech! They're wee speakers angled a certain way for optimum listening. Take them off your head and hold them at arms length - you can still hear them!
I felt conned as i wasn't getting an authentic product, even more so at 80 quid!

However, they're really ergonomic. I can lay down in any position and also wear them whilst wearing glasses too, and different style hats which is a bonus when I'm playing dressy ups. The battery life is great and the sound is good enough for general use - around the flat I'd say 20 to 25ft BT coverage at most which is good considering how slender these things are. I wouldn't recommend it to audiophiles or for the 'ASMR types'. I can't listen to jazz or classical with these. I've been told from the other end they're not so good as a phone call headset. But I've never had a set that were. And to be honest i hate talking to humans, so who cares anyway..... Amaright? 

Im not sure how the manufacturer can claim bone conducting tech as this is completely misleading, false advertising and a total lie. But must admit they're the best Bluetooth headset I've owned and they don't go on or in your ears which, for someone who suffers tinnitus..... And rickets, is an absolute dream.

Bit of a mixed review. If these were 20 quid cheaper I'd buy a couple more and highly recommend them. For 80 quid, I'll wait and find tech true to its word!

Soar Alba!

*Edit*
As of April these stopped working! So basic they re absolutely useless after a couple of months and cost me a small fortune for crap misleading tech. How is this legal under the trades description act! It's not!!!",1,B09BW29FJS,2023,the United Kingdom
R18HTRTPGF26HM,Not impressed so far,"My friend sold me on these (I use Apple EarPods) but I really liked the idea of being able to hear what’s going on around me while listening to podcasts/music so I bought these.

CONS:
1. They press in pretty hard on my head and I feel a sense of relief when I take them off.

2. The charging cord is USB > USB-C, so charging will be slow. I purchased this pair because of the usb-c cable when I really wanted the openrun pro because it has more bass, but was turned off by the proprietary magnetic charging cable. I wasn’t counting on the fact the other end of this charging cable would be USB which is ancient technology now. It should be USB-C > USB-C for rapid charging like the OpenRun Pro has.

3. The charging cable is so super short I have to lay my Shokz on the floor to charge them.  They were very stingy with the length of the charging cord!

4. Every time I move my head the band that goes around the back of my head moves the part by my ears around and the sound becomes distorted. There’s no way to adjust the band!

5. There’s very little bass at all in these and I read the reviews and expected this but was ok with it because I mostly listen to podcasts or true crime videos but the sound is weak at 80% volume with all treble and no bass. Don’t expect any bass from these.

6. Does not switch flawlessly between devices, you have to pair them every time, this is a deal breaker for me.

PROS:
1. I can hear what’s going on around me without having to take these off.

2. It has a long battery life.

I’m glad I bought this on Prime Day for only $59 instead of regular price of $79!",1,B09BW29FJS,2023,the United States
R2W7JQ926ZBHAW,Turned it on. Great. Wouldn’t turn on a second time zNG,"Couldn’t get it to work a 2nd time. Went through a horrendous exercise to return for replacement. Up to 8 emails back and forth. They couldn’t find my earlier email. Sent data 3x. Finally got replacement
Replacement unit was same as first. Turned on once and couldn’t start it again. Just arranged for another replacement
Not a fun experience. I’m in Canada and they wrote that they are sending me a USPS label and to take to USPS mailbox.  USPS is American and doesn’t work in Canada. Called them and was told no need to return faulty headset",1,B09BVX8ZXF,2024,Canada
R37QQ3P4RM4WA3,"For what I paid, I want to like these more than I do.","Most of the headset's problems stem from one fact: the fixed band is one-size-fits-all and cannot be adjusted for an individual fit, as one can with all but the cheapest of over-ear headphones.  Stickers to change the stripe color are cute but meaningless if I can't use the product.

-If you have long or thick hair, or you're larger than the designers expected (I'm 6' 1""), the fixed band length doesn't allow the transducer ends to rest in front of the ear where the book and photos all indicate they should.  Trying to hold them in the indicated positions results in a ""too-tight"" feeling and uncomfortable compression.  I can only see this working for someone who's 5' 4"" or has an ""approved"" hairstyle.  The model on the rear of the package has a buzz-cut, which should have been a clue before buying.

-Accordingly, the headset constantly tries to pull the transducers back into/over my ear canals.  That completely negates the ""open"" aspect of its design, so you may as well wear a pair of cheaper earbuds.  When that happens in use, the volume suddenly jumps by an order of magnitude (potentially deafening).  The vibration from the transducers can be nausea-inducing when they're out of position, especially when it slides over an artery.

-If you try placing the transducers elsewhere or wearing the headset any differently, the design angles don't really allow it to stay in position.  If the transducers are slightly out of position, it sounds extremely tinny, and callers won't hear you, but you'll leak sound to the surroundings.

-The USB charging port is on the bottom of the transducer, so the charging cable exits perpendicular to the headset: it takes up a lot of room while charging when it could have laid flat instead.  A minor irritation, but it means you're not going to be tossing anything over these.

-The band tries to ride a balancing act between too much clamping pressure and too little, but there's no way to adjust for comfort.  I can't see this staying in place through exercise that involves more than slight motion or vibration.  It refused to stay in place during a light walk.

-I haven't exactly been able to work up a sweat while using these, but the covered design seems like it should do an okay job of staying sealed.

-""Premium"" is not how I would describe the sound quality, but you have to temper your expectations for bone conduction: it's maybe a 7/10.  A good pair of over-ear headphones or earbuds does a much nicer job and cancels much more noise if that's what you're after.

The final verdict: this headset feels like it might work better for someone much smaller or in a culture with less individual variation.  Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so this lesson was expensive.  I wish I'd spent the money on something adjustable.",2,B09BW29FJS,2024,Canada
RCCYY7UE1DIGE,Dead in less than 4 weeks.,"I loved these headphones. I have a pretty big melon and have never found bone conduction headphones that fit properly. These are big enough so they sit where they are supposed to without pulling on my ears or getting dislodged when I turn my head. The sound is great, It doesn't cancel noise at all, but if you get some foam ear plugs it cancels enough noise so that you can mow the grass and listen to an audiobook or music without having to turn the volume up too far. that combo is also perfect for flying, even in the back of an airplane. I even wear them to bed for some white noise for about 20 minutes as I go to sleep.

And the battery life seemed excellent. I could charge it for a couple of hours in the morning and it would go all day long and still be good for 20 minutes or so of white noise. (maybe 4 or 6 hours of use).

However.

They died three weeks and three days after I got them. I was working in the yard on Sunday for about 3 or 4 hours, listening to an audiobook. I turned them off with about 50% battery left and went to take a shower. A couple of hours later I tried to turn them on and nothing. Dead. So I plugged them in to charge and about 6 hours later went to get them (I like to use then when I drive) and there was no blue light and they would not come on. I tried to charge them with three different cables and three different charging blocks in three different locations and nothing worked.

Since they are three weeks old, I tried to submit an online warranty claim and completed the whole thing before it rejected my phone number. After some faffing about, I realized I had gotten the UK version of the form. I looked for the US version of the form and my browser wouldn't let me go there because the link was not secure. At this point, I just got the number of their ""customer happiness agent"" from the main page's chatbot and called that.

Customer Happiness Agent is a misnomer.

I need this headset replaced, but since I am at work and don't have my warranty card on me, I had to look under the flap that protect the USB C port on the headphones and take a picture with my phone on extreme close up with the flash to see the incredibly tiny serial number on the device. It's like a microdot, you literally can't see it with the naked eye, it's so small.

So I take to the so-called Customer Happiness Agent, give her al the information, let her go through her script even though I just gave her all the information she was asking for (top-tip, wait until they suggest trying to charge with with another USB C cord because if you tell them before they get to that point in the script, you are wasting your time) and she said it could be replaced under warranty.

She sent me a return address label. I have 48 hours to return the headphones using this label and, if they are going to replace them, it may take up to 10 business days for me to get them. I almost told them to forget it, I would just return it to Amazon for a refund and order a new on through them because I could get it in a couple of days.

Then she told me that charging the headphones for more than two hours can damage the battery and I shouldn't do that. I asked if there was no circuitry in the headphones like you have in a phone that stops the charging process when the battery is fully charged to prevent damage to the battery, but all she did was repeat what was on her script. I don't recall having it on a charger for more than two hours except that one time.

TL;DR Great headphones, but don't ever have them on the charger for more than two hours or it will damage the battery and you will have a hassle returning it, and you will have to wait as much as two weeks for a replacement if it's under warranty. When you charge these headsets set an alarm for 1 hour and 55 minutes.  Also, carry the warranty card in your pocket or store a pic of it on your phone, just in case you need to access the serial number.",2,B09BW29FJS,2022,the United States
R3B1B86NO4RIBL,"Great concept, not so great execution.","I suffer with tinnitus and so unable to use earphones. I thought I'd give these a try but was pretty disappointed.
There are a number of issues I faced;
- they seemed too big, the part that goes behind your neck doesn't sit on the neck, I don't know if they were too big for me or they are designed like that, either way I could wear a hoodie or a coat with them as it would push this back part forward, therefore pushing the conductors out of place.
- I tried them with a beanie hat as I was going to go cycling and listen to music, but the bulk of them made it look like I had 2 big lumps each side of my head. I thought the hat would keep them in place but no, my coat still pushed them forward.
- The battery sections go behind the ear, and because they are so bulky they push your ears out, making you look like King Charles. I previously asked a question on here to see if they make your ears stick out and someone said they don't, but they most certainly do.
- They have to be in a certain position for them to work efficiently, but as previously stated, they don't stay in place, there's nothing to keep them in place apart from them squeezing on the sides of your head, the curved part at the back just floats there, bit of a weird design if I'm honest. I tried to rest the back part on my neck but then the side parts wouldn't sit in the correct position.

They are made for people with big heads/necks I'm guessing, they really should make smaller version. I returned them after half hour of trying them out.",2,B09BW29FJS,2023,the United Kingdom
R16D513ST7ZJJ8,Uncomfortable and poor sound,"I have owned two other models of Shokz. One I purchased several years ago. It was the top model and they renamed it since then. I can’t remember what it was. They were great, but my son’s dog chewed them up. I ordered the open run mini and loved those, but my daughter’s dog chewed those. Seeing a pattern, and not always noticing when they fall off my nightstand, I ordered this model. Immediately upon pushing ‘play’ on my audiobook I noticed a difference in sound quality from the more expensive models. Since I’m not listening to music on them, I can handle it.  Then I answered a call from my son. He asked where I was. He said it sounded like I was in a loud car and I sounded like a demon!  I am going through menopause, but I’m not exactly to demon status yet.  After wearing them for less than ten minutes I had pain behind my ears. They were pressing too hard against my head. This was not an issue with the other models. I took them off and noticed that the parts that go behind the ears seem to be magnetic. Again, different from the higher end models. I will try them one more time and if they are painful, I will return them.",2,B09BW29FJS,2024,the United States
R3U4C66PWJG1LO,"Bought for comfort, and it didn't deliver.","For context, I got these so I could listen to YouTube videos in a public space without disturbing others, while also being able to hear what's going on around me. In-ear headphones have been annoying me because they make my ears itch, and over-the-ear headphones are just too bulky to lug around comfortably, so I thought this would be a great alternative that resolved those other two problems.

So first of all, the sound quality isn't great. As I stated, that isn't really the reason I got them, but if you're an audiophile and you want to listen to music with somewhat decent fidelity, you will be disappointed. If this were the only problem, I wouldn't have returned them.

Instead, it's this next problem that bothers me. There is no way to adjust the band that connects the two nodes. It sure didn't seem like it would be an issue before I put them on, but once I had listened to them for about a day I noticed that the band would bump into EVERYTHING. I tilt my head upwards, and the band bumps the hood of my sweatshirt. I lean back and it bumps my chair. I have short hair now, but if I had long hair, how this band might interact with my hair would drive me up a damn wall. Because it isn't adjustable, the band can never sit flush with my head and also be audible to me.

There ARE bone conduction earphones that do not have this feature, but the ones in my price range probably sound like hot garbage, because on a cursory search I ONLY found sets that were either $30-40 or OVER $200, and nothing in between like a $60-100 range. It seems like bone conduction has a long way to go and so I guess I'm just stuck using over-the-ear for now.",2,B09BVZ4XFB,2023,the United States
R1WFMUO78A6YFW,Left speaker crackling and cutting out,"I have been a loyal customer of Shokz for many years, purchasing multiple products without issue and enjoying good quality sound and reliability.

Unfortunately, my most recent experience has been less than satisfactory. A few months after purchasing my latest Shokz headset, I noticed the left speaker began to crackle intermittently before it started cutting out altogether. This issue was surprising and disappointing, given the otherwise excellent track record of Shokz products in my experience.I understand that no product line can be perfect, and occasional defects are inevitable. However, this recent problem has somewhat marred my overall satisfaction with the Shokz brand. I hope this is a one-off issue and not indicative of a decline in the product quality I have come to expect.

Despite this setback, I remain appreciative of the innovative design and comfort that Shokz usually offers. I am hopeful that this matter can be resolved swiftly, either through effective customer service or a replacement, allowing me to continue enjoying their products with the confidence I had before.",2,B09BW29FJS,2024,Canada
R2FQ5DMPE2MRWA,"Comfortable, convenient. Very bad sound quality.","Just got mine. They seem reasonably well built, but obviously I can't vouch for longevity.

They are comfortable, and the environmental awareness is nice, especially for running, etc. Some of the reviews mention sound quality as being ""slightly lacking"" or similar. This is being far, far too generous.

The sound quality is bad. Music will sound like it's being played on a tinny speaker at the end of a long hallway, or over a traditional landline. Playing around with the equaliser will only help so much. It's like there's a very strong filter and slight reverb that you can't get rid of. Dynamic range is very poor, and abysmal at lower frequencies. Everything sounds compressed. Very distracting.

Mic is OK.

Even with a 10% discount and free pouch, these seem overpriced.

OK (just) for jogging/workouts or for voice chat. Listening to anything with decent production quality will make you sad. I regret buying these.

If you just want something for jogging, you'd be better off with pretty much any cheap in-ear earphones or over-ears with a band.

R38O8SNVSOMIZQ,"Uncomfortable, muffled sound","I bought these hoping they would work with my sensitive ears. Ear buds and head phones are uncomfortable and hurt to wear for more than a few minutes. I thought these would be better since it looked like they wouldn't touch my ears. Unfortunately my ears don't stick out much and the thick part of these push against the back of my ears and hurt. I've tried positioning them in different ways, but they push against my ears no matter how I wear them. The sound is muffled too, which I had heard was expected with bone conduction head phones, but it was more muffled than I had expected. I used the setting for spoken audio to listen to audio books which helped slightly, but the muffled sound was still so bad I had to turn the volume up. I wasn't able to listen at that volume for long before I got a headache.

R136PGQWPATCUM,NOT GOOD for calls,"My primary purpose was for making and receiving calls. I have purchased several bluetooth earbuds but none stays put.  They are fall off with the slightest movement. I bought one the goes around the ear but I seem to misplace it all the time. This one was to replace another bone constructed designed (a different brand) which stopped working within 8 hours of use. Issue 1. You cannot lay down on your back with it because of the design. 2. Any attempt to adjust it would cover the  mic and callers won't hear you well or sometimes not at all.  3. If it doesn't sit on ideal place you'll get a very uncomfortable vibration from the music or voice.
What I liked about it was the use of type c usb to charge it. That way you're not limited to the magnetic charger that other models use. With the magnetic charger you always have to carry that particular charger with you or you won't be able to charge it should you  need to.  Sound quality was ok.

R3V0VULHW41GWS,Comparing Shokz and Rythflo,"I really wanted to like these. I bought them after having some issues with my Rythflo bone conduction headphones that were the same price but had some extra features. The bottom line is that I'm not keeping either of them.

- Sound quality: The Rythflo has better sound quality - it's quite clear and not tinny. The Shokz sound quality is tinnier and more buzzy.
- Volume: The Rythflo volume is louder than Shokz but not loud enough for me to understand my podcast while commuting on the Metro. Otherwise, it is okay. Maybe it would be better if I used the included earplugs, though that seems to defeat the purpose of this headphone style. Shokz is much buzzier at a high volume. Not sure how it would hold up in the Metro because I didnt wear it for that commute, but I don't foresee it being better.
- Microphone: Rythflo has a clearer microphone than Shokz according to the person at the other end, who said I was ""very clear!"" when in a quiet environment. But it seemed to pick up ambient noise and was extremely loud at the other end when there was an announcement or something around me (e.g., while commuting). So it works well in quiet environments, but not in busier ones. The Shokz microphone has a bit of an echo on the other end. I didn't get to try it in such a loud atmosphere.
- Setup: Setup for both Rythflo and Shokz is extremely easy.
- Case: Rythflo comes with a much nicer protective case (see photo). Shokz comes with a bag that provides little real protection.
- Charging: Rythflo has its own proprietary charger which is magnetic and seem to work fine. Shokz uses a USB-C charger, which is more standard.
- Buttons: Shokz wins this one with a cool integrated botton on the outside that is much easier to find than fiddling with the buttons on the Rythflo to answer a call or whatever. But I'm sure the Rythflo is manageable once you get used to it.
- Fit: This was the killer. I don't know about your ears, but the sharp shape of Rythflo put pressure on the back of my ears that was quite painful after wearing them for a bit (see photo). Shokz, on the other hand, put pressure on my jaw hinge so when I talked while using them I got a very sharp headache. Not sure it it was also because the Shokz are very magnetic - does that cause headaches? But the Shokz were otherwise more comfortable for my ears. Neither of them can be worn well while lying down because of the back band.

R9RQI4BW6H7KQ,You get what you pay for..,Work great when there's no other loud noises near by. But I'm a heavy duty truck mechanic so there's times I can't hear the music over everything else going on. The battery life on it will last me about 5 to 6 hours of constant play while I work. One of the biggest drawbacks that I came across is the back of it is rigid. So when I'm using a creeper to get underneath the truck if you lay your head back it pushes them forward and knocks them off your head. I wish they were a more snug fit or you were able to adjust them so they fit snugly to the back of your head and don't move around. They stick about an inch off the back of my head.  Any loud noises around you're not going to be able to hear the music at all. The Bluetooth on them works great with distances and making phone calls.  I'm working a 6 Bay heavy duty truck shop. I can set my phone down on the far side of the shop and walk all the way to the other side with a concrete wall and semi tractor trailers in between and the Bluetooth still stays connected.,3,B09BW29FJS,2024,the United States
REJHEGGOWDYML,Flimsy as crap now,"The old Aftershock models were great. I had one last over a year and it took some abuse--regularly accidentally falling into soapy bath water. It wasn't even the water that killed it, it was me using an app to increase volume accidentally set to the max and POP. The band felt robust and had snap to stay on well, too, so it was great to go out in.

Then you have this piece of crap go out in three months. Sure, I get water-proof isn't soap-proof but at this price that's a terrible value. And while the band being lose fits more comfortably it also comes off easier which is overall worse.

R154PKT0BMY603,Good set of Bone Conduction Headphones,"First off, these are bone-conduction headphones.  They are not ""noise canceling.""  Some people just don't seem to get that.

I work at a metal fabrication facility and these type of headhpones have been OK'd for use on the production floor precisely BECAUSE they allow us to hear what's going on around us as well as putting in hearing protection and still have the headphones functional.  I've tried other bone conduction headphones and they struggled with the noisy surrounding environment to the point I couldn't use them because they didn't have sufficient volume.  These headphones are able to function despite multiple welders, steel being hammered and dropped, etc.  In short, they still allow me to hear despite a very noisy environment.

What I listen to most are ""Spoken Word"" items such as podcasts and audiobooks and streaming talk radio.  I do not use these primarily to listen to music so cannot comment from experience on the sound quality for listening to music.  My guess is that they would be ""functional.""  They would work and you can listen to music while doing other things.  But if you need to hear what the ""3rd violin is playing""...maybe bone-conduction isn't the best way to go.

PROS
--Volume.  They do have the capacity to overcome a noisy environment and still allow me to hear what is being said as well as allowing me to hear when others are talking to me without having to move/adjust the headphones.

--Lightweight.  These things are comfortable.  Not as heavy as other bone conduction headphones I've used.

--Secure.  They stay in place really well.  While certain head positions will cause them to slightly move I have had other bone conduction headphones that if I look up actually fell off.  These do not do that.

--Comfortable.  These things are really comfortable to wear.  I use them at work for most of my 8-10 hour work day and they have not caused me any discomfort whether due to getting sweaty spots where they set on my jaw/ear area, or just irritating the way other headphones (both bone conduction and non-bone conduction) have in the past.

--Non-noise cancelling.  This may seem like an odd ""pro"" but for me it is.  I have a set of Beats noise-cancelling headphones for when that is useful.  But most of the time I would rather have some of my hearing faculties.  Even nonactive noise cancelling over-the-ear/on-the-ear headphones do have some noise canceling which I sometimes don't want.

CONS
--Limited Bluetooth Range.  I have had other bluetooth headphones (non-bone conduction) that had much better range.  I could leave my phone on a charger and move all around the house with no loss of connection.  These are somewhat more limited.  However, if I have my phone with me or within a room or two I generally have little/no trouble.

--Vibrations.  As I said above, I sometimes need to use these at close to maximum volume.  When I do this I can sometimes ""feel"" the vibration as a buzzing that will ""tickle"" my jaw/ear area.  My guess is that this is not really a ""flaw"" but, rather, a function of it needs to vibrate fairly intensely to create the kind of volume I'm asking for.  In normal use in the house or in my office I usually do not need the volume NEARLY high enough to cause this sensation.

CONCLUSION
While there are undoubtedly bone conduction headphones that are superior to this I consider these to be really solid ""entry-level"" headphones.  I can vouch that they can handle an environment that requires hearing protection if in the environment for long periods of time.  I don't see why they wouldn't work really well in a non-noisy work/home environment or working out in the gym. I would highly recommend these.  I got them on Prime Days for ~$50-60.  Their normal Amazon price is $70-80.  If these broke I would seriously consider paying $70-80 to replace them.",4,B09BVX8ZXF,2023,the United States
R28AORKP2ONDGC,Great Company. Superb Sound,"this model is great value. Profound sound. Easy controls. Not a noise cancellation device, do not wear a toque over your ears. Comfortable, good Bluetooth range. 'Head band' should be adjustable to keep 'ears' in place. However, I won't lose my 4th pair of earbuds with the attachment!!!

I’m a painter and I appreciate that I don’t have earbuds falling into my paint tray anymore! Battery lasts for 5 plus hours on a charge. Sound quality is real nice. Works well even while wearing glasses. Only downside and I’m assuming with all of these type of headphones is I can’t use them mowing the lawn or in a noise environment louder than a vacuum. I did try using them with loud outside noise and cranked up the volume, but found the increased volume really vibrated my glasses.

Original Review:

The headset stopped working after 5 months, without any warning signs. Would not turn on and would not charge either.

I reached out to the vendor for a warranty claim. They responded to my initial email quickly, with a list of questions. I answered them all within one day. Haven’t heard from them since, ‘though I even followed up.

These still give my ears fatigue just now on a different spot, even with the technology of the shokz. I constantly have to adjust them to hear annything, even with volume all the way up. The headband behind my neck always gets caught in my hair and necklaces, it  doesn’t sit flush to my neck so I cannot comfortably lay down with them at all; therefore, cannot use them for any of the purposes I bought them for. The return window is closed. Going to try and sell them unless seller would like to still issue return/refund. I would not recommend these to anyone honestly.

R18N4P50T1DBTJ,Great for running  - when they work,"I bought these in May 2023 and used it 3-4 times a week for running only.  They worked great until they just stopped working around October 2023.  They suddenly would not charge or respond to any button presses.

I contacted Shokz customer support and they were great and sent me a new pair without asking for the old pair back.  Unfortunately, the new pair had issues of their own, as they would randomly cut out.  I tried resetting it, re-pairing it, and testing it on multiple devices but the same problem persisted.  I reached out to Shokz again but they are now ignoring my emails and closed my case.  My original pair did not have this cutting out issue, but it's evident now that there are a lot of quality issues with this product.

I would stay away from this product as it will not last.

I wore these while swimming. The sound echoed so it was painful to listen to them.

R31FYHP1J74HMV,No drums,"This was my first (and last) attempt with bone conducting headphones.  I had tried the latest Shokz models at a display stand at Best Buy and thought they sounded pretty good.  I was aware of the midrange bias for bone conducting, and how the display samples were clearly chosen with that in mind.  I also knew that this swim model was a couple of generations old.  BUT ... I was not prepared for the utter absence of bass.  It's not soft ... it's just not there.  I listen to Brent Lewis when I hike.  His music has a lot of deeply resonant drums mixed with midrange drums and a lot of higher frequency accents.  All I could hear were the midrange drums and accents.  It was a completely different musical piece, and an annoying one.  What I could hear of the deeper drums sounded like a drum that had been left out in the rain.

I like that it holds its own music.  The user interface was fine and I figured it out.  Comfortable.  Everything else was great, but goal #1 of headphones still has to be some kind of fidelity to the source music and these don't have that.",2,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United States
R90VZA913V5SM,A waste of time if you're a music streamer and have Apple products,"I have everything Apple, but needed some waterproof headphones for wingfoiling. I use my Apple Watch to monitor my speed, heart rate etc... which is fully waterproof also of course. I bought these becasue they seemed the best waterproof headphones, I thought that with them being a standalone MP3 player I wouldnt need to waste the battery on my Apple Wtch or worry if I forgot it or it ran out of batteries. I assumed that putting songs on the headphones would have been as simple as syncing an old Nano Ipod or something like this. But in truth it's much harder. I have all my old CD's boxed away and I burnt them onto a harddrive long ago that doesn't work anymore. If like me you stream from Apple Music, you're stuffed. You can;t put that music on headphones. Presumably it's the same problem for every streaming service. So without bluetooth these headphones are in fact useless for me. I didn't realise this. Anyway I have sent them back, but not after I spent a goos couple hours convinced it couldn't be this hard. But it is.

R9VKI1W64LFHK,"Good Sound but Not Easy to Use, Broke at Weakest Point","Bad News First:
These are MP3 headphones. Have you tried to buy MP3 lately? It's challenging. For some reason, I thought it was still 2001, and I had access to Napster. The truth is, only a handful of places sell MP3s these days. The choices are limited when you find one that does, such as Amazon.  And, if you have dreams of popping in your favorite novel, diving in, and then swimming for a couple of hours. Please forget about that. I listen to lectures, and I have to record the audio from the lecture on a sound recorder, convert it to an mp3, and then store it on the Shokz. It takes hours.

The second problem is that the charging point is a weak link. Eventually, the device swells, and the customized charger is challenging to snap in place. Also, the headphones' design leaves the tiniest section connected to the heaviest. Predictably, this means that mine broke at that point. This is why I'm here this morning buying a new pair. More on that below.

The Good:
The sound is much better than I was expecting. It's muffled and strange on dry land, but the magic happens when you go underwater. It's as though the music is playing in your head. The sound was clear and plenty loud.

Perhaps you had dreams of getting waterproof Bluetooth earbuds, leaving your phone safely elevated by the pool, and streaming your music as it does on your bike ride or jog. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Bluetooth doesn't work underwater. You'll get all of three feet, and the sound will cut out.

Final Thoughts:
I'm thankful that there is a decent product I can use while swimming. It makes the swim easier and more enjoyable. Mine broke after 1.5 years, and here I am buying another. That should tell you something. This time, I'm buying the warranty.",3,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United States
RHCQKSOPFS8AZ,Not sure if worth the money…,"I’m using for pool swimming.

With ear plugs (bought elsewhere not using the ones provided) The sound quality is impressive, better than previous headphone I have used, however even on max volume the volume is much quieter than other headphones tried, often results in missing some detail in the sound if pushing hard on a fast lap.

The number one frustration however, is the position of the buttons. With the buttons being on the back, it is very easily turned on in your swim/gym bag. I have had these headphones for 3 swimming sessions now, and each time walking back from the pool I can hear the headphones playing in my bag. What is particularly annoying is as there is no rewind/fast forward button, I have lost my place in my audio-book then having to edit the MP3 file on my computer to find where I was up to and start again from there, rather than simply rewind.

These were almost twice the cost of my previous pair, will certainly continue using, but not sure if worth it.",3,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United Kingdom
R7Q4QC61Q6EUS,"Expensive, no app, marginal battery life and limited usable audio files","I was expecting an app to manage OpenSwim, similar to other Shokz products, but was disappointed to find that management of this product is completely computer based and it has no Bluetooth ability. It comes packaged as a barebones headphone with additional usb interface, but with little in the way of instructions except for copious legal jargon paperwork to protect themselves against users (the Apple approach). You would think that for the cost of OpenSwim there would be at least some significant eye-catching feature, but instead the interface and file compatibility is completely basic (like its competitors) and the battery life is less than their other products. Riding the coattails of those other products, OpenSwim would seem to be the start of a great product line that sadly remains half completed.",3,B09CGPQ24X,2024,the United States
R1YOAV0O8HLJ6E,"Good Audio Quality, Total Lack of Storage","It should honestly be illegal to ship an MP3 player with so little storage. Flash memory is incredibly cheap and there's genuinely no excusing it. The sound quality is really good and I understand it's a very niche product, but i should be able to fit more than a handful of albums on something I paid $150 for.

RDVFKLFN43ZE2,Difficult to get current music on them,"I primarily use them for swimming, they work pretty well for that.

Positives = Obviously can swim with them on which is great. Comfortable to wear. Easy to toggle between songs, turn volume up and down, power on/off.

Negatives = If you don't have a wide enough head they don't sit very tight to you ear bones, which is where the music is transferred to, thus its hard to get good quality sound and get them loud enough (in my opinion). One major thing to be aware of is in order to get music on these things, it has to be MP3 or something of the sort, which means you can't download music from Apple or other mainstream music providers onto these. Its not compatible.
There are some smaller music providers that offer MP3 music but they don't have any of the popular/mainstream music and I still couldn't figure out how to get their music onto these.
Best (and only way) I have been able to get music on these is by RIPPING a CD which is challenging cause you need CD's, which in my case means old music.
I think I would purchase again just for the ability to listen to music while swimming, but I am pretty disappointed with the process of getting music onto these.",3,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United States
R3A8XRMKIQQJA,I have a love/hate relationship with these headphones,"I ordered the OpenMove headset about two weeks before I ordered these.  I absolutely love the OpenMove.  Great sound without anything in my ears.  The OpenSwim. . . I'm undecided.  The OpenMove is great for my five mile daily walks and gym sessions.  I also lap swim a mile four days a week.  So I got the OpenSwim specifically for my swim workouts.
The first day I wore them I was unimpressed with the sound I got while at home loading up some MP3's.  Particularly since I was so happy with the sound from the OpenMove.  I swam a lap and was extraordinarily disappointed.  I couldn't hear a thing during my freestyle and kickboard work out. During my freestyle, there was just too much noise from my arm strokes to hear the music.  During my kickboard workout the music quality was just terrible.  But when I fully submerged my head under water...Holy Cow!  What fantastic sound.  The problem is, of course, I'm rarely submerged while I swim.  I don't ordinarily do turn kicks because it takes too much out of me.  So even though I like the concept of not having anything inserted in my ears, for the last week I've been swimming with ear plugs in.
There's a marked difference in sound quality for the better with ear plugs in.  However, the music quality is still terrible while I'm doing my freestyle strokes. I'll compare it to having a radio playing by the side of the pool.  You know it's playing music, but you can't tell what song, or even what type of music, is playing. But my kickboard workout is much more enjoyable. BUT, the problem that I was trying to avoid by not having in-ear headphones is painfully smacking me in the face.  With the ear plugs in I can't hear a single thing going on around me at the pool.  I can't carry on a conversation with my lane neighbor.  I can't hear people calling me to get my attention.  I hate being so situationally unaware.  It reminds me of visiting NYC a couple years back and looking at all the idiots on the subway with junk in their ears.  None of them knew what the heck was going on around them.  I'll try them out for another week.  But for the price, I just don't think they're worth it.",3,B09CGP8MVH,2023,the United States
R3OGPPDL3MGXW3,"Sound is Great, but comfort is not!","I tried this and returned it. The sound is great. Loading music is easy. Though you have to actually purchase the music to load, which is annoying if you are like me and just stream your music. However, I can get past that issue. What was really annoying was the lack of comfort in the design of this headset. It needs to go under the swim cap to stay on, which makes it really uncomfortable. It also gets in the way, when doing freestyle. So the end result was that I returned it.",3,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United States
R2T6VQBCLZ8SB,"Great sound, great for swimming, but battery life is poor","I absolutely love these headphones in terms of sound quality and comfort, but the battery life is nowhere near 8 hours like advertised. I think the battery life was high at first, but after just a month or so of daily use they started running out of juice after as little as 90 minutes of use. I typically swim for 40-80 minutes at a time, so I've just resigned myself to charging them after every swim.

Note: When these headphones are running low on battery there's a message that comes through every few minutes. It always startles me. If you're easily startled like I am, don't let your battery get low. ;)

While swimming, these do sound best with earplugs, as other reviewers have mentioned. Earplugs aren't necessary. They just keep the sound consistent as your ears go in and out of the water.

Other than the minor inconvenience of the short battery life, I think these are excellent headphones and I'm really grateful to have them. I use them every time I swim, both because my playlist serves as a timer and because the music covers up the sound my pool makes (I have an older Endless Pool and the sound of the swim machine is a little annoying to me).

I have seen some reviews complaining about the hassle of getting songs onto these headphones, but I found it very simple. If you're intimidated by transferring files to a thumb drive, or if the mere thought of having to transfer files fills you with rage, then I guess maybe these headphones aren't for you.",4,B09CGP8MVH,2024,the United States
R2HJEJIIOLPER7,Xmas present for the wife - she loved it,"Wife very pleased with this piece of tech as she has started going swimming a few times a week before work. Sound quality is great for what it is and you are still aware of your surroundings.

RV1PADKK6N3L,No bluetooth,"There’s no Bluetooth! So you have to go to Spotify (or whatever) download MP3, plug this into your computer, and transfer the files. Very old school!

R1FR9Q1MQEYS0E,Decent for swimming.,"I actually own the Aftershokz Air version as well so I speak with some experience.

This version is an MP3 version of the other versions. You have to load songs or audio books on it. It is a usb 2.0 connection so it is kind of slow to load vs a usb 3.0 but I don’t find it bothersome.  It holds a charge well - better than the blue tooth version. It fits better than the Air version - there is next to 0 chance it would fall off in the water unless maybe you wiped out at speed behind a boat. You need to wear earplugs if you are doing laps as the water rushing by your ears overwhelms the sound from the unit. Wearing earplugs solves the problem but I was hoping you wouldn’t need it. Sound is much better under water.

All in all I would get the Bluetooth version vs these if I had to choose between the two. If you can’t carry your phone (running and or your wife doesn’t want you to have your phone with you all the time….) or you need for swimming these are fine. Quality is excellent.

My 2 cents.

Buttons are simple and easy to find with fingers, and responsive. Easy to upload files, it's just like a thumb drive. Sound is pretty decent, put on ear plugs provided for a more consistent sound quality above and below while swimming. Delivery is fast, well packaged. Worth paying for quality. Even if it last only 1 to 1.5 years as what I've read in some reviews, it's still super worth as I look forward to my swims! Highly recommended!",5,B09CGP8MVH,2024,Singapore
R2DSFFFN200X6J,Worth its price,"I used it 3 times up to now. It is worth to every penny I paid. I swim 3 times a week and approximately 1 hour. So sometimes it may be boring to do the same path 40-45 times. This really helped me to enjoy more.
Only issue is trying to find MP3s, luckily I still have the archive from the years before Spotify. This is the only hard part to deal with, but it is very normal since Bluetooth does not work under the water.

If we come to the experience part, put on this headset, put on the earplugs and put your head under the water and you will not believe the sound you have. dont expect a high quality headset of course, you are under the water and you receive the sound from your bones but if a high quality headset is 100 points, this is 60-70 points.

The package included the headset, USB connector/charger (very cool) NOTE-if using a Mac, you will need an adapter, nose clips (way too tight), and ear plugs. Copying music is easy. The sound quality in the water is great, it is even better when the earplugs are used because the water in the ears can muffle the sound. The earplugs solved that. The controls on the ear piece were easy to use while swimming.  They are very comfortable. I actually think my swimming improved by having the music!",5,B09CGPQ24X,2024,the United States
R3SP5HJQD4R27,ALMOST FANTASTIC,"UPDATE 2: I wish I could return them. They are almost useless for phone calls. I have the latest iPhone, pro model. They work great for music/movies/podcast and such. But when talking on the phone the headset FREQUENTLY stops working, I have to toggle back and forth between speaker and the headset to make it work again. Support is either too incompetent to understand my issue, or they just don’t care. So I guess I get to go spend MORE money on other bone conduction headphones because these perform so poorly.

UPDATE: Changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because the headphones have become basically unusable for their intended purpose.

They work okay with music and streaming, but PHONE CALLS, one of the main reasons I bought them, are more frustrating than helpful. I am having to constantly toggle back and forth between Bluetooth and speaker because it just turns into dead air. The phone call will proceed and someone will be talking, they can always hear me, but I can’t hear them!!!

I called and explained what was happening and I was offered a new pair, but it’s been TWO weeks and I still haven’t received anything. I just talked to them again and they asked me to wait ANOTHER TWO WEEKS and when I voiced my displeasure with having to wait a whole entire month for a replacement I was put on hold and then told a new pair would be sent ASAP. But who knows, that’s what I was told last time and here we are, two weeks and an updated review later.

These are (no longer) BY FAR the BEST headphones I have ever used. I have been through at least a dozen pairs of in-ear buds. They all hurt my ears or are far too uncomfortable within minutes of putting them on. I also feel like I lose my situational awareness and for me that brings on anxiety.

I have no complaints from friends and family about being able to hear me talk when using the mic on phone calls. The ONLY thing that could possible make these headphones better is an adjustable band. I am definitely glad I went with the mini version, but even they are a kind of large on my unusually small-ish head.",1,B09F3JTFH5,2023,the United States
R1ZWDTHZNVC63B,Annoying vibration,"Trying to find comfortable, out of ear, headphones for my tiny noggin and my 8yr old grandson (who will definitely break them within 6-8 weeks! Lol)

I bought the Shokz OpenRun Mini ($130), the Wildhorn Crank mini ($120), the Togetface Kids ($18) and the GenXenon kids ($27)

I am astounded that both the Shokz & the Wildhorn suck as bad as they do!

The speaker vibration is out of control! Both of them felt like, if I were to hold my phone up to my face/ear while it was ""ringing"" on vibrate only.

Returned both.

The Togetface fit me amazing, but a little awkward on the grandson. Super lightweight & comfortable, forget I'm wearing them & I can lay in bed and not feel them against the back of my head. Sound quality is really good, but max volume is a little low if you are in a moderate+ noise environment. The button-less controls still give me a little trouble, but maybe because I'm 54! Lol.

GenXenon was a little small for me, but fit gs well.  Plastic around ears is much harder, bulky & not flexible, but somehow, still very comfortable. Sound quality is good.

ZERO vibration on the Togetface or the GenXenon!!!

For $18 the Togetface is the clear winner & an absolute steal!",1,B09W4TLYC3,2024,the United States
R1FE38VZHHZ6Y4,Great headphones ruined by horribly obnoxious features...,"Overall these are great and work well and have good audio quality for what they are and how they work. Unfortunately they are ruined by horrible software and ""features"".

I got these and the regular sized OpenRun Pro's. The pro's fit me better. I have a big head and fairly thick neck. The mini's still fit but were pulling on the top of my ears a bit and became uncomfortable over time.

Pros:
1. You can hear everything around you while listening to music or having calls.
2. They are comfortable and stay put.
3. Audio quality is not as good as earbuds or over the ear headphones but impressive for what it is.
4. They are water resistant.
5. They have multipoint and supports multiple devices being connected at the same time.
6. They have a mute feature where you can mute the mic on the headphones themselves instead of the phone or computer, however the feature is ruined by constant beeping while muted.

Cons:
1. Auto mutes the headphones after a video call starts. You have you unmute by pressing the vol+ and vol- buttons at the same time. Sometimes it auto mutes again. There is no way to turn this feature off.
2. When muted on the headphones, they beep the whole time you are muted. Why? Who thought this was necessary and a good idea? There is no way to disable this.
3. When multipoint is enabled and 2 devices are connected, if one device disconnects the headphones beep continuously for the next 5 minutes. Why? Who thought this was necessary and a good idea? There is no way to disable this.
4. Multipoint is not enabled by default. There is no reason for it not to be enabled by default.
5. No way to update firmware on any model except the pros so you are stuck with horrible ""features"" and firmware you can't change.",1,B09F3JTFH5,2023,the United States

I changed out the charging box, and it still did not charge. I spent a ridiculous amount of money because I wanted quality.

Purchased these April 2024 hoping to love them just as much as my first pair; however, the design changed and I CANNOT STAND THEM.

My first pair (2018) was designed to sit on top of ears with about a ninety degree angle over the ears for the speaker. The current design (2024) wraps around the ear from front to back like a U-shape. This is not what I’m looking for. I HATE that the U-shape touches (and taps if running) the back of my ears. My ears stick out slightly, so this design is not comfortable for me to wear. They are irritating to wear, and I couldn’t ignore them after wearing for a few minutes.

They are not good at:
- holding a charge (you have to unplug them as soon as the light turns blue or they start draining the battery, sooo you get to stand there and watch them? Or plug them in right next to you and make sure you sit there for two hours)
- preventing migraines
- volume
- having a microphone people can hear you with, despite it being attached to your vibrating head
- not digging into your neck, or generally jostling around and ruining the sound quality
- not needing to be turned up so loud that you can feel the sounds vibrating your whole jaw, and those around you can hear it because why yes, they ARE just regular speakers!
- being comfortable
- not needing to be paired with earplugs so you can protect your hearing from said outside noises, furthering your discomfort
- being priced well and fairly for what you get and for how long it lasts (reminder, they are noticeably losing quality after two months, and the return window is one month)

RWOJ2UJCVIT0E,Battery life dreadful,"After my previous Shokz (roughly three years old) started struggling to hold more than two hours' charge, I decided it was time to upgrade. I was particularly enticed by the new model's claim of (up to) eight hours of battery.

Unfortunately, they switched themselves off about two hours into a long run despite being fully charged at the outset. After it happened again the following Sunday, I contacted warranty support, who suggested this was due to me using them in extreme temperatures (5°c). Various approaches to troubleshooting later, I was sent a replacement pair. In 6-9° climes, they shut down after 2:25. I've been advised again that battery life is adversely affected by lower temperatures, leading me to believe this product is not fit for purpose in the United Kingdom for much of the year.

Back to the drawing board guys. Let me know when you have a product suitable for typical temperatures in the places you sell it. Also sort the charger situation out; why ditch the USB C for a charger that's useless for anything else?

R1ROT2IJ94M91R,Love & Hate Relationship,"I don’t often leave reviews but this product requires one to warn potential buyers. I have a love/hate relationship with the OpenRun Mini. I’ve bought my 1st pair back in 2020 when it was branded/named as Aeropex Shokz. My 1st unit died randomly while on a bike ride, sent it for a warranty replacement, got the replacement, and same thing happened a few months later. So I thought, it just might be a bad luck having 2 units fail on me. I swore off buying one of these for a while until they rebranded their line to OpenRun. So I took a chance believing they have fixed the issues regarding these devices and bought my 3rd “OpenRun” mini (which I think is just a reskin of the old units). I’ve put the Aeropex Shokz/Openrun/whichever you want to call it to test with running and cycling. To no surprise, this OpenRun mini only lasted for 6 months until they started having the same issue as the previous models. I really think these bone conduction headphones are not quality standard yet because they claim they are sweatproof but they seem to short circuit whenever I use them for sport activites.  They just randomly fail and die on you. I didn’t bother sending it for another warranty replacement and bought Airpods Pros instead (which by the way are still working a year later). Whenever somebody asks me if I would recommend them, I hesitate a little bit because one hand, the idea is there, but don’t I want them to buy a faulty product because I’ve had too many bad experiences with it.

I barely had to adjust the volume (or the earphones themselves) because they were so loud.. the had wonderful speakers. I rarely had to turn the volume all the way up- barely even passed 1/2 way!  But these?? The design change doesn’t grip the ears like it used too. Constantly slipping and feels fragile…I get it- “make them sleeker and thin. People love thin things!” Aside from having to adjust them to have them sit right… I have to turn the volume all the way and still can barely hear when the volume is all the way up. It just sounds like people whispering in my ears.  The only way to actually “hear” anything is if you wear an additional ear plug and that’s not why I bought these..

Maybe this pair has a defect in them?? I dunno. Planning on returning these and buying a different brand. Paying this much for earphones I can barely hear out is a waste of money.

Bone conduction headphones are odd, in that you often hear too much of the outside world while trying to listen to what's playing. That said, they are comfortable and sound quality is mostly good. Anything with a lot of base can be annoying as it's just vibrating your temples and it's not comfortable.  My complaint is their customer service and build quality. I bought two units. I got the normal size for me and the mini for my wife. The mini ones snapped after a month and a half. They no longer press against the temples so are useless.  I followed the RMA process, got approved and mailed them in. They use very slow 7 day mail service to return them before review and approval. After you get an email saying they approved the RMA, nothing happens. I emailed for an update, providing my RMA number and they say they'll get right on that and ask for my mailing address. 2 weeks later I get the wrong size.

I am making a warranty claim through Shokz because I am a little disappointed that these would not make it through a long run and therefore, wouldn't work for me.

I liked that I could hear what was happening around me while listening to audio. The headphones did not press uncomfortably on my face. Most earbuds end up hurting my ears, these did not seem like they would. Sadly though the problem was that the sound kept cutting out. I tried resetting the headphones and my phone multiple times. They would play a few songs alright and then start cutting out again. I will be returning them. If it were not for the sound cutting out I would have kept them.

RFKIJO7DMPTQ6,Too Expensive,"I've owned a couple of bone conduction style headphones over the last few years, mostly around £40 in price. Only one came from a fairly well known brand (in China) and they were the best pair I have owned thus far, including this pair of Shokz.

The pros:
+ Good sound - I don't need to have the volume up at full volume to hear podcasts over my workplace/traffic. They beat out any other pair of bone conduction I've had in that respect and I'd say that overall the sound quality is better.
+ The band size - they're slightly less in the way than previous headphones have been, although they still jut out, meaning that at least one thing is more comfortable than with other brands.
+ Charging - these have a much better charger and clearer indicator than other brands I have used.

The cons:
- The price - I do not think they're worth £130 (approx) at all.
- Low comfort - I find them to be the LEAST comfortable bone conduction headphones I've worn thus far. While originally they seemed fine, minus being a little tight against the skin, the more I wear them the less comfortable they are. My ears hurt from wearing them and I specifically wear this type to avoid that.
- Vibration - While I do expect vibration from this style when the volume is high, and while the fact I do not often need the Shokz turned up that high minimises this issue, these vibrate heavily and the sound distorts slightly when they do.
- Battery - the battery is fine but all of my cheaper pairs held charge either to a similar level or higher.

Overall, I'd say these aren't worth the high price I paid, but for somebody struggling to find a pair that fit they might be worth a punt. I am highly sensitive to pressure, however, so others may also find these much more comfortable than I do.",3,B09F3JTFH5,2024,the United Kingdom
R3PE6UD7RL7Y74,Swings and roundabouts,"I was desperate to love these.  The smaller band is a real asset to me and my tiny pin head, but alas the audio was unacceptably bad.
Playing Spotify via the WiFi resulted in a patchy connection that skipped every few seconds.  I tried switching from 2.4ghz to 5ghz, I tried lowering the audio quality in the spotify settings, I re-paired, I made sure other devices were far away, but it did nothing.
Using data was absolutely fine.  No problems with the audio there (albeit a little bit lacking in depth).
So I guess I'm saying,  if you're only going to use them out, then they're great.  Super comfy, lovely blue colour.  But if you'll be using them at home a lot (like myself) and don't want to burn through your data allowance,  then maybe try a different brand.

R2EKAX6P34B87S,"Read Before Buying. Honest Review of a Well Made Product, that is NOT for Music.","Skip to bottom if you don't want the details.
For certain purposes these headphones are excellent, but in most cases they will be very very disappointing. These are a very well made, and high quality product and I like them for my very specific use, but I would NEVER recommend them for general users or music lovers.
I have plenty of good things to say but lets get the bad stuff out of the way.

If you plan to use these to listen to a lot of music, these are NOT the headset for you. Do not trust any review that says the sound quality of these is any good. It is not good. Honesty its embarrassingly poor. Especially when you consider the price of $116. I workout with a $25 set of over-ear buds that in terms of music reproduction blows these shokz out of the water. Not even a close contest. If your budget is $50 or more, there is no reason to consider these for music. Just look elsewhere.
When worn properly they do not get very loud, there is no depth, and there is ZERO bass. Everything is hollow and tiny. Bass and rich sound requires air pressure and since these don't use speaker cones/diaphragm to create changes in air pressure they will never be capable to recreating rich tones and bass. Honestly, putting your phone in a shirt pocket will recreate music infinitely better that these headphones will.
The only other thing I think people will not like is, at higher volumes the headset does its best to recreate bass, but instead its just a weird vibrating/buzzing feeling on the side of your face. I kinda got used to it, but it's still jarring at times and never ever feels or sounds like bass.

Okay now for the good side for general users. They are seemingly very well made, should last a very long time, packaged nicely, easy to operate, the battery life is excellent, and they very comfortable even for prolonged use.... That's about it. Oh and call handling is superb! Which brings me to....

Why I like mine.... I use them for calls in the field. I work in an environment were I use my hands and need to communicate. These never fall off and handle calls really really well. I hear them they hear me boom.

Things to consider:
-If you do buy aftershocks, DEFINATELY GET THE MINIS, even if you have a huge noggin. The minis should be the new regular to large size. My wife has a big 'ol brain box, and these fit her great.
-I prefer to keep things out of my ear for general ear health, these are good for that.
-Good if you need to hear the outside environment, riding bike etc.
-Never fall off even when working upside-down.
-Proprietary charger. Its a nice magnet charger and works well but its the only one you get.
-For non music uses its really great. Phone calls, audio books, pod casts and talks.
-Sucks for music and movies.",3,B09F3JTFH5,2022,the United States
R334JXIYH08YZQ,"Love everything else, LOATHE the charger!","I bought these Shokz to replace my original Aftershokz which came to an untimely end when they were chewed apart by a dog. I wear them all day every day, and use them in pretty extreme conditions - both pairs have held up well to constant wear outside in all kinds of weather.

As a female bodied person, I like the shorter headband on this pair of Shokz. My old pair with a standard band would sit awkwardly on the hood or collar of outerwear during cold weather and would shift around when I would look up or sit back in a chair. I also think the sound quality is better in the new pair - lower tones are clearer, and I feel like I don't have to have the volume as high to hear podcasts in louder environments. This may be due to the snugger fit and less shifting.

I also really appreciate the long battery life. I wear them all day, playing music and podcasts off and on, using them for zoom and phone calls (microphone seems to be clear - I haven't had any complaints), and only once have I run out of battery life.

Now for the bad. The old pair of Aftershokz used a type C charger. Since I already have a bunch of these around the house, car, and at work, I was never far away from a charger. This current pair of Shokz has a unique magnetic charger. Fine, I though. The battery life is long, and I usually only have them on the charger at night - it's a little annoying that I would have to bring the charger with me or buy a second one to charge them anywhere else, but fine. However, I'd estimate that the new charger only makes a solid, viable connection to the Shokz about one in every four tries. The charge light comes on regardless, so every morning is a stressful guessing game of 'have the Shokz charged'? And because I only have the one charge cord, I can't get them charged in the car on the way to work as I used to. Most mornings are a scramble to check the charge level multiple times while I get ready, and hope that I find the magic spot where they're really drawing power.

This is a small problem in an otherwise excellent product, but it's a problem that causes a lot of unnecessary stress every morning for me. These headphones are literally life changing for me, but I almost returned this pair over the charger. Shokz should either switch back to a type C charger, or needs to change their current design so that the indicator light only comes on when the Shokz are actually drawing a charge.

When you dock the earbuds in the charger, the earbuds unpair. Great. This is how it is supposed to work. But while still in the charger, if it stops charging - either because the buds are fully charge or, maybe, it just feels like it (it is pretty random) - then it pairs again... tethering your phone mic and speakers to earbuds that may be on the other side of your home (on the bright side, good bluetooth range). Clean the contacts all you want: there is no cure.

R26U7W7LJ8QHR7,Bluetooth Connection Requires a Long Press-Down of the Earbuds' Buttons,"The set I received from Amazon didn't work; it turned out to be faulty when I sent it out for repair at SONY Care & received a new set as a replacement. The new set worked after I was able to get the Bluetooth connection to finally work. It only worked properly & consistently after I restarted my phone.

The earbuds are a pleasure to use while it works; the sound is great & it stays secured in my ears.

However, the main reason I bought a wireless earbud is to connect it to my DAP (Digital Audio Player or simply mp3) but, for some unknown reason, this earbud's name doesn't appear whenever I try to register & pair it to my DAP via Bluetooth. I know my DAP works cos it is able to connect to my phone & generic Bluetooth speaker without a hitch. The problem is the earbud as it also won't connect to my siblings' phones either. Guess I have to continue using my wired earphone for my DAP for now. It makes me wonder if certain earbuds only work with certain DAPs...

Obvious to say, I am quite disappointed with this purchase.

UPDATED (12 Feb 2023):-

The earbuds finally connects to my DAP! It seems that SONY's Bluetooth functions differently from others; it doesn't connect automatically. I have to really press the buttons on the earbuds down for quite some time before it goes into Bluetooth pairing mode; I pressed it down for more than 7 seconds before I got it.

Now I'm happy :D Thank you, SONY!",5,B09HJJ5VKN,2023,Singapore

R2WKAUJCZSOVNG,Poor sound and very uncomfortable,"I was really hopeful when I purchased these as they came recommended. I was expecting that sound quality was not going to rival my other headphones but as I paid for the more expensive 'pro' version I was expecting a decent quality. The manufacturer states that these are ideal for music and 'pack an enhanced bass', which I think is misleading. Perhaps its the enhanced bass that causes these to vibrate in your ears, which is extremely uncomfortable and gave me a headache after ten minutes. This happens at even low - mid volume with a standard EQ. The design itself is awkward and clumsy. The band sits at the back of the head and extends out quite far.  If you lean your head back or if your clothes or hair (etc) push against it, the whole unit pushes forward moving the ear pads out of place. Maybe the non-pro mini version is a better fit as it has less bass. I'll be returning to my regular earphones unfortunately.",2,B09LT46284,2022,the United Kingdom

R3B9QSDWHF8YBV,Very bad audio quality on macbook during calls,"I'm using the headphones primarily with my macbook every day & iPhone sporadically.
Wearing comfort is as expected & good.
When the mic of the openrun pro is used for a call on the macbook, the audio quality immediately switches & becomes very bad, it's like I'm listening to music on a legacy phone call.

Therefore assigning 2 stars since
- the audio quality is bad on the macbook during calls
- the audio quality during calls on the iPhone is good & as expected, so the hardware seems to fine

So to sum it up, I'd not recommend it since it's the top model of the shokz sports/open series that comes with a certain price tag on it but do not meet the promoted premium audio quality on a mac book.",2,B09LT46284,2022,Germany

R2MENI9U6GBPVE,"Great for cycling, good for outdoor running, okay for office working.","These are niche headphones, designed for athletes. For outdoor running, these are decent. You can keep your ears open on the trail, or hear a marshall yelling instructions in a race. Run on a path next to a busy road, and you'll still hear the music, but podcasts start to become difficult to hear clearly.

For cycling, these are really good. It's important to be aware when cycling, and these allow just that. Again, podcasts can be difficult to hear in busy traffic.

For the office, these are also good as it allows you to listen to podcasts, music or take calls, whilst still keeping an ear out for colleagues.

Where they fall down is for the gym and public transport. Even with earphones, these just cannot be heard over the pounding of a treadmill or even the gym's speaker, or the chit-chat of dozens of people on a train.

In terms of build quality, then I've snapped one pair (Shokz replaced them under warranty) then the battery would not charge (Amazon gave me a refund) - Although this left a sour taste, as it didn't give me a lot of confidence in their build quality, I can confirm that the customer service was excellent and quickly rectified my issue.

I found them extremely comfortable to wear, and would happilly wear them all day. but the band at the back does protrude out from my head, so sitting in bed, or lying down with them is not possible without risking a snap.

All in all, I would recommend them for outdoor runners and cyclists. There are probably better options for office workers, and they are definitely not suitable for the gym or public transport.",4,B09LT2R5XK,2024,the United Kingdom

R3OIIPJDPKDQL5,"Perfect for cycling but, inevitably, can't hear audio in high winds or very noisy environments","I wanted these so I could listen to podcasts while cycling, to give me something else to focus on during particularly difficult climbs or boring stretches. I tried them for the first time today and they seem to do the job really well - very clear sound without distracting me from traffic around me. The downside is that when travelling fast downhill or into the wind, there was far too much noise in my ears to hear the audio - but it's really easy to pause the audio with a quick press of a button (perfectly doable even with thick winter gloves on), so that's what I did. I figure it's probably better when going fast downhill to have your wits about you, so it's no bad thing to pause a podcast at that moment anyway - so I'm treating it as a safety feature!

SHOKZ offers three models in ascending order of upgrades: Open Move, Open Run, and the top-tier model, Open Run Pro.

If traditional headphones tend to slip from your ears, this headphone is an ideal choice. If cost is a concern, consider Open Move; however, if budget isn't an issue, bypass Open Run and choose Open Run Pro instead.

With an IP55 rating, it can withstand various challenges, although it's essential to note that it's not fully waterproof.

I have one complaint, and it's not worth a star deduction, but it may be an important caveat for other buyers.  The headphones on default configuration sound okay, but you really need to set them up with the Sony headphone app to get the full effect.  The problem is there is no equivalent for it available on Windows currently.

R1S5EJ5NP3S2VL,Turn themselves off ... ALL THE TIME!,"Hateful product.  Apparently they turn themselves off when they can't detect your head. Seems they suddenly decided after two weeks that I don't have one, so they turn themselves off every 30 seconds or so.  I got so angry I tried to clamp them to my head and broke both flimsy arms on the horrid things and $500 bucks down the drain! Save yourself the pain and find a less ""clever"" pair of headphones.

R1VB71X3T7AO5,I prefer the Bose QuietComfort II,"I have to agree with the reviews of these phones.  The music sound quality is really excellent, perhaps slightly better than my Bose Quietcomfort II.  I have no problem either with the noise cancellation, although the Bose allowed you to do it on a scale of 1-10.

However they are really not as comfortable.  They grip the head very firmly, giving me a bit of a headache when I've been using them for a while.  Trying to wear them wearing glasses was impossible.  The arms of my glasses physically hurt my ears.

Trying to register the product on the Sony website was a nightmare.  They kept wanting me to ""voluntarily opt-in"" to having Sony spam me.  And then the process kept failing.  I eventually had to ring them, and had to speak to somebody who barely spoke understandable English.

Overall, if somebody was considering buying these or the Bose, I'd go with the Bose every time.",3,B09ZFD9CBB,2024,Australia
R2ZGE5YFVJT70X,ANC is a letdown and no huge improvement over M3s.,"Nearly $500 for ANC that is probably little better than my M3's. Devastated. I'm actually devastated. I could at least read when cricket (and only cricket) was on TV nearby they were enough to make it tolerable. These I've got no chance hence no use case for that outrageous price bracket. I was hoping for an improvement to make my life better as am disabled and stuck at mercy of carers/blaring TV. I updated software, I turned off Ambient, removed it as a button option, did all the troubleshooting they recommended. 99.5% sound blocking is coming from just having new/decent pads. UPDATE: other user correct, there's an issue with right ear, poor Sony. Poor. I put my hand over the right ear to turn off ANC (prior I'd been using the actual button) and that kicked ANC into better gear when I took hand away. Shouldn't have to do that. Also, personally I don't think it was worth the upgrade price at least for me given I'm used to decent already w/the W3's and that price point is agony for a pensioner.",3,B09ZFD9CBB,2023,Australia

Any amount of fiddling with the equalizer doesn't fix the problem - just produces different flavours of muddy.
If you want crystal clear sound, just go with Bose.

Edit: After a whole weekend of fiddling with the equalizer settings, both using the Sony Headphone app and additional tweaking on the Equalizer settings on the Spotify app, I've got it to sound pretty good.

R1JQJPP1LZ6ST,RETURNED. Not as good as MX3/4. NOT EVEN CLOSE!,"I returned after 1 day. Could not stand it and very disappointed.

I have been a big fan of the MX series. I have purchased MX2, 3 and tried MX4. Been using MX3 for 3+ yrs.

I knew about the folding issue from the reviews and i am not going to pick on that.

Cons in order of priority and Reasons why I returned it after 1 day:

*Poor low end sound quality and bass. I remember when i tried the MX3s, I was blown away by how diff and amazing the sound was compared to the competition. Punchy bass, while still retaining excellent mids, highs and stereo spread without being muddy. Thts what stood out from the rest. The MX5s low end comes nowhere close. I believe its largely due to the smaller drivers. And Sony trying to sound like the other high end brands. There is no life to the music - its flat with a slightly more pronounced mids and highs. Nothing special for a $500 headset. U will get similar sound quality from much cheaper headsets. Better yet - get the MX4 or 3 of u want to enjoy ur music.

*Bad comfort. This is the worst headset in this range when it comes to comfort. Its tighter on your ears and the ear pads r not as soft as MX3s or 4s. The top band is narrow with not much of a soft cushion. Gets uncomfortable real fast. For someone who travel long distances, its an absolute deal breaker! Its a shame since when i used to wear the MX3, it was so comfortable and feels like a nice big hug around ur head whenever u wear it - thanks to the soft pads, less stress on ur ears and wider, softer band on the top. The MX5s r nowhere close when it comes to comfort.

*Poor built and lacks overall premium feel/quality. I got the sliver version and the moment I took the headset out, it felt like cheap plastic. May be too early to judge and i cud be wrong - but i dont see this lasting for more than a year of constant use. Features like vocal prompts when u change the ANC, ambient mode etc is not there anymore. They have definitely cut cost on the materials, driver size, sound quality and features like this.

Few pros i could find:

*Faster response with touch controls. Features like music stopping when u speak etc r fast and responsive
*Better call quality. Much better than MX3/4. But still not best in class
*Better multi device connectivity. Its not seamless mind u. But better than earlier versions.

I did not find any major difference or upgrade to the noise cancellation quality compared to MX4.

As u can see, the pros r not critical features that u would make u buy a headset like this. All the main features like sound quality, comfort and built quality have taken huge step backwards. For the first time I am extremely disappointed with Sony!",1,B09ZFDYKP3,2023,Singapore

I chatted with the Amazon online service customer today but was told that the promotion team informed that all have been redeemed. I have mailed in a working set of headphones but it's now all wasted. I am very disappointed with the handling of this trade-in promotion.

And it's not consistent but on and off out of nowhere. I've been googling to see if anyone else experience the same problem to determine if the headphones are defective or some setting issues I've got.

R19JNR8EWGNIM3,An investment for PhD Student,The noise cancelling works wonders. Very recommended for glasses-wearers because it doesn't push the handles onto our temple as much as other brands.

R3OVGC4HMW0AUD,Refund this noisy sony trashcan,"The sound is not worth the price, don't bother.
I'm 12 hours into owning them (5 hours used with 1 charge wich is not at all enough) and the left bud randomly started to emit a loud white noise that sounds like the ocean. I go online and look for a solution and there are hundreds of people who are experiencing this problem. I avoided the MX4 because I was aware of these manufacture issues but here we are. After intensive searching I try resetting them individually. Still nothing. I do it 5 times with both and reset everything for the 10th time. Noise fixed. I get on a phone call and 5 minutes in, it's back. I try resetting again, nothing.
How is it that you pay a premium price for ""premium headphones"" and they're consistently trash, they have concurrent issues in every iteration, and the only solution they offer is to ""send them in to repair"" or ""don't use noise cancelling or ambient mode"". I won't be sending in 300$ headphones that I've used for 5 hours total into repair and I will certainly never again own a piece of Sony headphones because of their terrible quality control and customer service.

R1975E8RA3A67N,"I want to love these, but alas, i'm left a bit unsatisfied","Confession, i lost my Sony WF-1000XM4's which i loved dearly, so i was trying to save a bit of money and got these as i read the positive reviews. I am no sound aficionado, so i wont go into that side of things, but the convenience issues i have i just cant shake them off...
1 postive, they are amazingly comfortable, i would wear them all day BUT...
Biggest negative, the battery length is incredibly short, i like to wear these for work, listen to music and do Teams calls... pretty much every day they must be charged between 12-1pm - the XM4s lasted my whole work day
Other negative, they can pair with as many devices are you like, but you have to always manully connect, the XM4s just deteted whatever was the last, and if that was off whatever is in range. These dont do that, theyll connect with whatever was last, but require manual connection to grab whatever is paired and on.
Other negative, they regular just distort, for no real reason... like a quick resync... not too often to get angry but often enough to notice and get annoyed.
Other negative, ANC is good but not great, but maybe i got used to the power of the XM4's so i am judging too harshly...
and the last negative, DONT BUY THE WHITE ones, like i did, they get grubby SO fast. My XM4s were white, and they stayed white the 2 years i had them, but these earbuds ive only had them for a few months and they are really dirty, will never be white again :-(",2,B09ZFD1MVH,2023,Australia

R3BUHM097IIP5Q,These are buds are amazing BUT Battery case issues,"I like my LinkBuds S, they have got great sound and noise cancellation is not bad. Got it on sale
They are very light and comfortable on the ears, i've worn them on planes and trains and even on trampolines (although i don't recommend using them on trampolines as they do fall out) but other than that they have been a great companion.

UNFORTUNATELY, I'm on my 2nd Linkbuds S and it has broken again. 1st within a few months, 2nd unit used for about 11 months.
Both my units have this issue where the battery case stops working and because its not working. It doesn't trigger the buds when you open the case unless you have the power plugged in. which also means THE BUDS will NOT switch off after when they are in the case. As the buds no longer sense the case. Both my units have this issue.

They are great buds, i'm just not sure about the quality though, maybe its the Amazon batch (early 2023) though.",2,B09ZFD1MVH,2024,Australia
R3T64UQJRVAYXM,Just okay,"I've had these for a while, sounds quality is good. The audio pass through is good as well for ambient listening. However functionally these kinda suck. If you separate these from the case while use, you're subjected to constant random disconnections... They just power off. I wear them at the gym and they do this maybe 2 or 3 times within the hour. With the case nearby this still happens just not as frequently. The left bud will often disconnect from the right as well, meaning you have to remove it from your ear and put it back in and magically it reconnects.
The touch controls have a 50% success rate, like for skip song it's two taps... Maybe it picks up one and then pauses. Maybe it doesn't do anything. Sometimes you get no response for hours for no reason. They haven't always been this broken so perhaps this is due to a faulty software update. Which brings me to the app, which is one of the worst designed piece of software. You can see the reviews for that on the app store. The headphones boast a 'find my device' feature... However if you lose your headphones while they're in their case or powered off? You're out of luck. Pretty useless for a premium product. I bought these on release and the price was almost immediately dropped by Sony after its clear they weren't selling which is frustrating in itself but that's the way the news goes.",2,B09ZFFWG7L,2023,Australia

I normally prefer the ones with a little wing-tip / airpods pro design for a secure fit. After reading through many reviews, I took a step of faith and ordered these Sony WF-LS900N Linkbuds S.

R3B659X5BLZGJH,"Wow! Clean, detailed, beautiful sound in wide soundstage!","The product looks so non-descript, plain & downright basic, but put them on & play music through them - they blow your mind away! This is my first pair of Sony bluetooth buds - where have I been all these years? The sound coming out of the buds, as my title says, is clean, neutral, detailed, beautiful, refined & has the widest soundstage I have ever heard in any pair of buds. It never gets ruffled at higher volumes. It got me so excited after around 6 uses over around 1 month, that I immediately called up the Amazon app just to write this. Sure, there are some negatives about the buds - the cables are too long & flap about when I use them while running. I found a simple work around for that - cross the cable from the opposite sides over the front of the neck to the opposite ear, making sure that the left bud goes into the leftt ear & the the right one into the rigbt ear. The volume up & down buttons are down & up respectively. I just got used to that & remember which end to press for what I need. There are no magnets to keep the buds together while they are hanging around my neck like a necklace. My work around - tie the 2 ends together in a light knot. They don't come with any case or bag to keep them in. Work around - used an old case from another pair of earbuds that have died & which have been discarded. One negative about the sound - the bass does not thump & music with thumping bass comes across quite flat. Plus side - I don't get a headache. Other pluses - pressing & holding the volume up/down button to skip or replay a track is signalled by a nice jingle. A final plus about these buds - they have the longest battery life. They never seem to drop below full charge after several uses. Is there something wrong with the battery level detector? Don't know but it has not gone flat on me so far. The best part - they are budget buds. What more can I say? Enough, actually.",5,B0B5ZJSKJ3,2023,Singapore

R1BYOCRYYN6Y05,A very gimmicky product. I felt misled by many reviews.,"I bought this thinking it would be a great alternative to my airpods pro 2nd gen for working out. I've watched and heard all the reviews, saying things like ""don't expect it to sound that good because it uses vibrations"" and ""it's so comfortable"" and ""It's perfect for working out since it is more secure"".

To simply put it, I found all of these claims to be lies. Maybe my unit was a lemon, but the sound quality was quite horrible. It was unusually quiet, and the sound quality was just lacking in all frequencies, making it feel like the audio was coming from a fish bowl.

I would have forgave the bad sound quailty if it was genuinely comfortable. I measured my head before purchasing the mini, trusting the reviewers that claimed that the mini was more comfortable for smaller heads. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Especially for someone with glasses. Even without my glasses, I could constantly feel the pressure these placed on the side of my head, and behind my head when I turned my head around.

If you already own a pair of Airpods pro 2, use transparency mode, and the experience is much better than these. Only get these if you're a person who cannot get airpods pro to stay inside their ears, or work in a job where your boss won't allow you to cover your ears for whatever reason, then maybe get these headphones.

The only ""pro"" I could think of is how it genuinely does use bone-conduction, and if you're in to experiencing a new way to hear audio, then it does do what it advertises. For me personally however, the technology using bone-conduction is still quite away from being great. For the price, this headphone is complete theft. If it was $50 or less, I would have been a lot more forgiving of this product.",1,B0B7QKT986,2023,Canada
R10I6OP895GWEH,Disappointed!,"I have been wanting these headphones for quite awhile but they have been out of my price range. Once a week or so for about 8 months, I would look them up to see if I could catch them on a huge sale. I compared them many times with others in this price range and these were the ones I wanted. At Christmas, they were finally on sale and I also finally had the money to buy my dream headphones. I was extremely happy. When they were delivered, I rushed home after work because I was so excited. I couldn't wait to finally have these and hear Crystal quality headphones.

I opened the package, charged them up (didn't take long), I put them on and paired them to my phone. And then, the moment was here. I booted up Prime Music and started listening to a song. Immediately I realized something wasn't right. They sounded horrible. I checked all setting in Bluetooth and in the Prime Music app. I even tried adjusting the equalizer in the app. Nothing helped. I even went as far as paring them to a different phone. They honestly sounded like the speakers were blown. You know how you can turn up the volume to max on cheap speakers and they sound horrible and distorted. That's how these sounded but at any and all volume levels.

I was so disappointed that it was kind of like a heartbreak and I even cried. I waiting so long to be able to own these and the ones that I received were defective. I'm not saying all of their headphones sound like these did. I'm saying the ones I received were defective and or course I would receive them. One would think they would have done at least some kind of quality control because I don't see how these passed any quality control.

So here I am, typing up a review of what I didn't get for Christmas because I was expecting a top of the line item and what I got was heartbreak and disappointment.",1,B0B7QKT986,2023,the United States
R2ULJXTZ0ZX3RZ,Only worth $25 tops,"I bought these for gym use and for running as I sweat a lot & in ear headphones get slippery and fall out so I gave these a try…twice!

The sound quality isn’t great compared to any in ear headphones but again not why I bought them. They are comfortable and I ran a couple half marathons with them and they NEVER got uncomfortable or bothered me & they are really lightweight which is really the only selling point!

However, for a price point of $175 I expected one of two things to really impressive me. 1 was sound quality which again wasn’t great and the overall volume level isn’t very loud but does allow for you to hear surrounding sounds while using them outside which is nice. The 2nd thing that would have made them worth the price point is battery life. These advertised 10 hour battery life while listening to music which I need for when I attempt to run my first marathon. Unfortunately the first pair I had only lasted 4 hours from a full charge just playing music continuously. I thought maybe I got a bad pair so I exchanged them for another pair and to my dismay the 2nd pair only lasted 3 hours & 45 minutes! This isn’t even remotely close to the 10 hours they claim to get.

So, not great sound quality and battery life well under half what they advertised really only means these are good just for needing a pair of headphones that aren’t over the ear or in ear & are lightweight and for just that factor alone they should only be priced around $35-50 like all the competitors.

A $175 pair of headphones should either sound great or last more than 4 hours on a battery charge. The way these are marketed and advertised makes them seem like they could compete with AirPods or beats but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Very unhappy with my purchase and am returning my 2nd pair.",1,B0B7QKT986,2023,the United States

R1VIR0A484FFOU,Not that great of a product - quality of sound and noise cancellation are subpar,"I recently found out that I have contact dermatitis, which basically means that my inner ears are sensitive to any kind of ear bud/pod plastic and/or the tiniest bit of bacteria that forms on them. Because of this, I thought this bone-conducting open-ear headset would be perfect because it sit right in front of my ear and not inside. Well, I just got it, charged it up, and tested it out. Here's what I found:

Music: I'm pretty eclectic when it comes to music, so I tested on different genres pieces. When testing on classical (Chopin) a movie soundtrack (John Williams), the sound was pretty good, but I had to put the volume up mid-way just to get a decent sound. When putting the volume at max, I could catch a bit of static. Then, I play something with bass (Depeche Mode) and it wasn't that great. In fact, there was barely any bass coming through at mid-volume. And when I turned up the volume, the ear pieces started shaking against my face and the bass was gave a lot of static.

Phone Call: I tested the sound and noise cancellation while on a call with my cousin just now, and it wasn't okay. I mean, I could hear him and he could hear me, but I tested the noise cancellation by running the kitchen faucet and he said he couldn't hear me very well. In other words, the noise cancellation didn't work at all, which sucks because it would very difficult to hear one another if/when using this outside in public crowds and/or street traffic. Oh, and btw: another thing that isn't so great is that, when a call comes in, you have to press the side button of the headpiece to answer the call. If you answer the call by tapping on the phone, it won't connect to your headpiece.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd have to give this a 4 -- not great, but good enough to prevent future ear infections.",2,B0B7QKT986,2024,the United States
R31I0AF56UE2EZ,These did not work for my specific needs.,"I listen to podcasts and audio books almost daily and for hours at a time. I listen while cleaning, gardening, you name it, and I need to be hands-free. I also go out to eat alone and sit at the bar eating and listening. I have Bluetooth headphones that fit inside the ear.  I recently started getting irritation from the ear bud being inside my ear and someone suggested bone conduction.

The negatives:

1:  I can feel a pulsing and buzzing where these connect to my skin. I found this really distracting and annoying. It also made my skin itchy. It might me something you get used to over time.

2:  I got the mini and they're too big. The rigid strap that goes around the back of the head (not adjustable)  sticks out. This prevents me from leaning back or laying down because the strap pushes the ear devices forward and out of place. Weird design for sure.

3: They are just not loud enough. At full volume I can't hear when I'm vacuuming, leaf blowing, etc..

4: These are like having speakers strapped to my head. Everyone around me can hear what I'm listening to. This is especially bad when I'm out to dinner and listening.  This is the biggest negative for me.

The positive:

1:  I don't have to insert anything in my ears.

I can see how these would work best for certain activities  (outdoor running, cycling, skiing, etc.) and you need to be aware of your surroundings.  For my specific needs these don't work well at all.",2,B0B7QNLCQB,2024,the United States
RNWJM6F1EH60N,Would not recommend,"Tried them on in a running store and liked them so decided to purchase but realized quickly they actually suck when you do anything other than just stand there. They’re not very loud even when the volume is turned all the way up, and when the volume is about half way and up, they vibrate and (at least for me) it would really tickle and that was pretty uncomfortable. I don’t know if I just got sent a bad one but the battery life was awful. If I didn’t charge them in between every run (which was never more than about 30 minutes) they would die on my next run. I made it 6 minutes into a 30 minute run once when they died after only using once. I learned they needed to be charged very often, even if it says medium battery. It was nice because you could hear your surroundings but overall would definitely not recommend.",2,B0B7QNLCQB,2024,the United States
R4SAE95SRDJ7R,WILL CONTINUE TO USE EARBUDS,"I wanted to like these headphones, as they seemed to be a better idea than continuing to use earbuds.  I used them to listen to music on my iPhone when I walked, as well as when I watched movies on my iPad.  I had several issues with them.  The rewind/repeat function on the multifunction button did not work.  The buttons overall were somewhat frustrating to use, as they don’t stick up very much from the headset.  I took the headset off several times to see them, rather than trying to feel for them.  The sound was not loud enough when I used them with my iPad, although was fine with my phone.  I wear glasses, and the headset was uncomfortable over my ears.  I returned them after a few days.",2,B0B7QKT986,2024,the United States
R2NPCMUBE0I01U,not as good as the bone conduction ones,"I recently lost one of my Shokz bone conduction headsets, and I needed a replacement- as I use them for everything: work calls, workouts, shopping,... I have a pair of AfterShokz Aeropex - Open-Ear Bluetooth Bone Conduction Sport Headphones from 2021 that I use for work and a second paid of SHOKZ OpenRun Mini (AfterShokz Aeropex Mini) -Bone Conduction Open-Ear Bluetooth Sport Headphones I got in April 2023. Both of them are bone conduction, and the sound volume is excellent.

These Open Run Pro mini seem to be a mix of speakers and bone conduction, and for me, this combination does not work at all.  This new version is very disappointing volume-wise and in battery longevity.  On this headset the sound volume is extremely low. I have to turn up the volume at 80%+ to hear the sound at a discernable volume when I run on the treadmill ( not with my other two headsets). Unlike the previous versions I have/had, this headset has speakers on three sides, but there is a significant loss of sound, which makes it rather useless. The battery doesn't last as long either, possibly from using the headset at a high volume. This Pro version may work well for others, but in my case, I got a lesser product that's more expensive. I don't feel good about returning a used product, so I'll keep them as spare.",2,B0B7QNLCQB,2023,the United States
R1W4HSQ3U3FEEX,"Extremely overpriced, very low quality product","- The sound quality is terrible. Very muffled and no bass. Even cheap pairs of bone conduction headphones have much clearer audio than these do.

- Media controls are very annoying to use. Most bone conduction headphones seem to use the much more convenient method of holding the volume up for next track and hold volume down for previous track, with a separate button for pause/power. These are very awkward in that holding the volume up button turns the power on/off and holding volume down does nothing. Instead, you need to press the button on the left bud once to pause, twice for next track, and three times for previous track. As with every pair of headphones that does this, it doesn't always register all of the button presses, or you might not have pressed them quick enough, resulting in things happening that you didn't want.

- Magnetic charger is very annoying. Get a pair of headphones that use USB-C so you don't need a special cord just for these.

My $25 pair of bone conduction headphones are significantly better than this $180 pair. Clearer audio, USB-C charger, and convenient media controls for 1/7 the price. Don't waste your money on these.",2,B0B7QKT986,2024,the United States

Tonight I began receiving the incessant low battery alerts after less than 6 hours of use at less than full volume. That includes pause time when I need to focus more on my work than my podcast.

After a few test, I started to notice headaches and dizziness. I put it at rest for a couple of days and tested it again. Clearly, even in a normal use (quiet environment), headaches and dizziness reoccurred every time. I did a quick internet search and found that indeed, some people are suffering from similar symptoms while using bone conduction technology.

- Great while going for walks because I can hear vehicles approaching
- Thanks to the bone conduction, I can still hear podcasts/music with having in-ear ear plugs while mowing the lawn.

Cons:

-Randomly disconnects and/or turns off. This can be annoying and aggravating because it happens in the middle of a meeting (sometimes while I am talking). The most it's happened is 5 times in an eight hour period while working (6 total for that day)

R2ZTFRIUA29GQQ,They are great... for music in quiet environments,"I do love these. But there are some pros and cons:

Pros:
*Not in my ear. That's a major pro. A big one.
*Sound quality is good. I'm not a huge music buff. I just like to listen to classical while I work.
*Comfortable. They barely bother me after a few hours.
*Discrete. They aren't very visible
*They work even w my long hair. I put them under my hair in the back.
*Battery life is decent. Lasts me a couple days at work. I don't use them all day long.
*You don't have to take them off to hear people or talk to people, though I usually still pause whatever is playing as it can still be distracting
*They work decent for phone calls. My dad said they sounded really really clear. I was pleased as I didn't expect a mic. They worked better for phone calls than for watching movies. The audio wasn't bad for a call.
*They connect really easily to my iphone 12. My son had trouble getting his to connect and stay recognized with his laptop and his iphone 6s, but I have had no problems.
*Charger connects easily because it's magnetic. They charge fast and that's using my PC USB port.
*The case is slim. This is a big plus. They're also flexible and they don't seem like they would be easy to break, even without a case.

Cons:
*They are not noise cancelling AT ALL. I know this is a feature not a flaw, but you cannot hear the music at all if anything else is going on around you. I switch to my Raycon earbuds if there's external noise.
*Not good for TV/Movies. I can't understand/hear dialog on these even though they work great for music. It's too quiet even on the loudest settings. I use my Raycons for dialog podcasts or shows. But they make my ears sweat and itch. I do prefer the comfort of these. These seem to work pretty well for phone calls though, so I'm not sure why the inconsistency. Even when it's quite around me I cannot hear a movie regardless of what platform I try them on.
*They are MOSTLY comfortable. They do put some uncomfortable pressure on my ear tops over time, but that's hours. Also you can't really lean back in a chair or on a pillow with these as they don't sit flush on your neck. I got my son the regular and the mini for myself and he ended up getting minis too even though he has a huge head.
*They do buzz a bit and it can tickle. I don't listen to high base. Mostly I use it for classical music to try to destress while I work. I don't find the buzz bad
*The charger is proprietary  so don't lose the cord. And you have to bring the cord with. Not a problem for me as I only keep them at work.
*When the battery starts to get low it constantly says ""charge me"" which I find annoying. Just say it once or twice and let them die. Don't repeat it every few minutes until it dies, which can be a good 20-30 mins after you get the warning.
*It's not really a con, but these come with a headband. I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to be incorporated and turns out it's simply a headband. It doesn't wrap around them or anything. I think it's so that if you have long hair you can keep it back from under the conductive plates as they don't work well if there's anything keeping them from making contact with your skin. But I was confused until I googled what it was for.

No idea how they work for sport or exercise because I'm fat and I don't run. But they seem pretty secure on my head.",4,B0B7QKT986,2024,the United States

After some recommendations to try Shocks and seeing a lot or Pro runners wearing the brand I opted for the new OpenRun Pro mini with a significant discount for black Friday. Initial impressions were amazing around the house, and indoor workouts all sounded great (not as good as dedicated over ears or premium in-ears) but not perfect - more than sufficient for running music motivation or podcasts.
Where these really shine however is in comfort, safety, call quality, battery life and sturdiness.

Comfort: wear them for a feew minutes and you will forget you have them on, super lightweight and the fact that they're not in your ears blocking external noise means you can easily wear all day (with the excellent battery life) and have zero issues

Safety: as mentioned they do no block out external noise, so expect no noise cancelling here. What they do allow yoy to do is hear your surroundings perfectly. Out running you will hear people, bikes and cars coming up behind you. And in the gym or running with friends you can have a quiet conversation with the ambience of good music in the background.

Call quality: as the microphones are not sitted in the ear like my previous earphones the mic are much closer to the source of my voice, and for me because of the bone conductivity I could hear others even when it was incredibly windy... not something I can say for other headphones I've tried before.

Battery life: these should last 12-14 hours on a single charge which should get me through most of my weeks training with few issues, when the season allow for ultra running, Marathons and endurance events I'll never have to worry about battery life impacting my day

Sturdiness: you will forget your wearing these headphones and they will stay in place just as yoy left them regardless of the activity intensity or duration.

I'm super happy with these headphones as you can see and will keep them with me for all workouts in future.",5,B0B7QKT986,2022,the United Kingdom
R2CDTM4AZTTJK3,Let me hear what's happening around me,"I like these bone headphones as when I'm walking I like to listen to podcasts .
Not good if you like loud music having said that they are okay for reasonable  volume.
I recommend these bone headphones. The battery runs for a long time between charges.

The volume is not loud enough for several of the songs on my iPod. (Yes I still use iPods.) I tested a song specifically with these headphones, stopped the song and then plugged my Apple earbuds (yes, plugged wired Apple earbuds) into the iPod and restarted the song and the volume and quality was significantly better with the plugged-in Apple earbuds in the iPod.

I returned these the same day they were delivered. I played various types of music (rap, folk, EDM, rock, etc.) to see how it sounded. I also tried audiobooks and podcasts. Any sound that had bass rattled against my skin with an annoying tickle. I could feel the music playing, which was super distracting, especially with the volume up the way I like it for running and exercise. The headphones didn't stay put, and my hair was in the way even when in a high ponytail. I kept having to readjust the headphones, which was a pain.

The band is too big. I bought the pro set and it was really big. Then went to the mini and it is still really loose. The material the bands are made of just loosen up with wear as well so it gets looser.

I never had this issue with my AeroPex or OpenRun mini's (have since seen others report that problem though).  I returned my first pair of the Pro's to Amazon and got a replacement.

I tried to file a warranty claim through Sony and they declined it stating that damage to the item is not covered and that I must have used excessive force, this is FALSE!!!  There was no excessive force used, and in looking at other reviews, other folks have had the exact same issue.  My warranty claim was denied and Sony only offered a $10 discount on another unit.  No thank you, these need to be recalled.  I'm currently looking at options for a class action lawsuit before going through arbitration because this is not right.

R1EGZ1DE5BA70F,24 hour experience -- Returned,"TL;DR They became bricks within 24 hours

I bought these headphones for a specific reason: range. I have a more expensive pair of Bluetooth headphones, but they cut out from walls and have poor range. These ones DO NOT have that problem, they have very good range and don't cut out while I'm cooking dinner or pacing around during meetings.

... So why the negative review? They lasted one use and then bricked. When I received these I charged them to full (light went on to show charging) and used them for maybe five or six hours during the work day before they turned off. I didn't get a ""battery low"" notification or any sound to indicate low battery, but I assumed that was the issue. I plugged them in and no light came on. I tried all kinds of different chargers, but still nothing. Pressing buttons does nothing, plugging it in does nothing, they're bricked without even having them in my possession for 24 hours.

In a way I'm glad, because I then looked at the 1 star reviews and found out that this is a common problem. I could get a replacement and hope that they'll not be duds, but if these things can turn into landfill waste within 24 hours of use, then I don't doubt that I'd encounter the same issue in a month, two months, six. I don't want to deal with that.

 However, after less than a year, the left side just...broke off. I don't throw these headphones around, especially since they're on the pricier side. I keep them in the glove compartment of my car as well, so they're not seeing any wear and tear.

Keep in mind that the one year warranty Sony offers does NOT offer any physical damage coverage! I spent two days attempting to contact their customer service, only to be told to contact their repair company United Radio. Who then contacted me and said that since these headphones are not covered within the warranty, they can't even repair the headphones since they don't know what parts are required. (NOTE: The wiring for the headphones are completely in tact, it's literally just the hinge that snapped.)

R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,"Big Hype for Big Price, Not recommended","I bought this during the Great Indian Festival, and the price was slashed down to 7,998 from its usual price of 9,999. I also got a 10% discount on my SBI card, so the price was close to 7,190. Delighted with the deal, I ordered the black color as my favorite blue was priced 2,000 INR more. I got it delivered within two days, thanks to fast delivery by Amazon, of course, probably if you are a Prime member. After using it for the first 15 minutes, I wasn't quite impressed. I called Amazon Customer Care, but they refused to accept the return, so if you want to buy from Amazon, be sure to try it at a local Sony Shop or Mall if it's available there. So being unable to return the product, I was forced to continue with it, and here are the things I noticed:

Sound quality - To date, based on all the headphones and earphones that I have used, I think it is one of the best. I haven't used top-of-the-line headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, etc., so the sound quality, based on my audio experience was pretty good. Also, some reviews say it is close to XM5, though there is a slight discernable difference in clarity.

Sony App and EQ Settings- I tried to fine-tune the music to my hearing taste, and the music sounded a bit better. The app asked for a picture of my ear to adjust the sounds according to the acoustics of my ears. I found these features a bit overhyped. While there were some changes in audio, and some features may indeed work, most of these things are hyped as stand-out features for marketing purposes to attract consumers. Also, I have tried using the headphones without these settings, and although there was some difference, it sounded good even without these fine-tunings.

ANC - It cancels out some noises in the background like the buzzing fan on my ceiling, but it's unable to cancel out the sound of my family members speaking around me, the TV audio (even though it is quite far in the drawing room and I am sitting in my bedroom), so it can cancel noise upto a certain degree beyond that it is of no use. I had watched a lot of Tech Reviews of various under 10k headphones before going for this one, they all have a similar problem, ANC works only up to a certain dB of noise, though it is understandable. If you want better ANC, probably go for higher-priced headphones.

Dual pairing and call quality - I use my headphones for many purposes like calling for meetings, listening to music, watching YouTube videos, movies, etc. So, a dual-pairing headphone would have been very much useful for me. While I considered this headphone, this was also one of the features that I had in mind. But the result was disappointing; dual pairing works, but the sound quality deteriorates severely. According to my research, in dual pair mode, it doesn't use the LDAC codec; rather, it uses the SBC/AAC codec, resulting in a deterioration of sound and call quality. In many cases, the person on the other side couldn't even hear clearly what I am saying. So, the call and music quality are both below average, or you may even say poor in dual pairing, which makes this feature irrelevant.

Connectivity - While in dual pair mode, it also experienced connectivity issues. There were times when the headphones got disconnected, and I had to manually switch or reconnect them. Contacting Amazon's customer care regarding this issue didn't help.

Battery life - Before I purchased this, I had seen tech reviews claiming it has amazing battery life. But when I used it (I use it for office work as well as for my entertainment, so I use it 8-12 hours a day), I found that the battery life is not that great. I use it without ANC most of the time as I am working from home. The battery ran for about 3-4 full days, which is 30-35 hours, much below what Sony claims.

Comfort - I have heard in many YouTube tech reviews that it is comfortable, but actually I found it quite opposite. In my opinion, ANC headphones under 10k are a big waste of money, especially if you are in hot and humid regions of India. The reason is that due to ear padding and isolation, your ears will heat up within 30 minutes and sweat, so you have to remove the headphones. Also, even though its padding is soft it's quite tight on the ear, and after 30 minutes of use, it causes discomfort, and you have to remove it.  So, I can't say it's very comfortable. Unless you are working in air-conditioning most of the time in hot and humid climate, it's better to look for TWS buds. If you are looking for noise-cancellation headphones, look for passive noise cancellation headphones that comes at much cheaper price with matching sound quality; there are a few below 3,000 INR which truly sound equally well.

So, to summarize - In my opinion, it is a big hype for the big bucks you spend. If you get this for more than 7,000 INR, it doesn't seem worth it unless you like the brand name. If you are keen on quality ANC headphones then raise your budget; otherwise, at this price, I don't think I am fully satisfied with what it offers.",1,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,India
R17WWS0YOW6PM1,Poor quality product,"I had doubts about these headphones when they arrived back in July 2023, i should have returned them. But I put those doubts aside and decided to keep them and see how they were. The sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but I've never bought any at this price before so that's not saying much. I've never had noise canceling before, but these seem to be okay for the most part. The bluetooth latency is noticeable on video watching. The problem is comfort and build quality. The ear pads are not good. You can often feel the speaker touching your ear. My ears become sore after periods of wear time. I've had these now for 6 months and as my picture shows these are now broken and Sony does not cover this under their warranty. This is from normal wear. They never leave my desk when not on my head. I have never traveled with them. They are poorly made with cheap plastic materials. In my opinion this is caused by stress on the parts simply by putting the headphones on and taking them off. They are very tight on your head but not so tight your head is pinched. You can not buy replacement parts for these as I have searched. I will not be repurchasing any Sony headphones as I've now seen this same exact complaint with many different models and their lack of backing up their product. They come with a 1 year limited warranty but Sony denies this as flaw in their materials and design. Investigating a repair cost and it could be nearly as much as the headphones cost me (i got them on a prime day sale).",1,B0BS1QCFHX,2024,the United States
R3F9I5SHEZEJJK,Disappointing; Plan to return,"TL;DR: Okay if you use bluetooth only at home; Will be returning; Got Yamaha MT5 headphones instead and those worked out of box

Good:
Comfortable fit
Affordable price
Detachable cable
Good in mid range, acceptable bass

Bad:
Bluetooth has trouble connecting in crowded places. Headphones were previously paired, but had lots of trouble connecting while I was on the train even though headset was next to my phone

Noise cancelling is not actually noise canceling. It's only noise reduction where it lowers the intensity of the ambient sounds.

Tinny on the higher ranges

Buttons were too flat, hard to adjust by feel alone

Build felt cheap despite being $100

Ugly:
The wired mode is completely unusable. When plugged in with power off, it has a warped sound as if you're inside of a static filled cave. When plugged in with power on, it's super static filled basically like trying to listen to a song on the radio but it's in between radio stations. Adjusted the settings in the app, but no difference at all. Tested on my cell phone, 2 laptops, 1 tablet, and a desktop PC. Wired mode completely unusable.",1,B0BS74M665,2024,the United States

In retrospect, it was probably a return from someone else that discovered the same thing I did - the microphone does not work when connected to a PC.

I returned it for a replacement, and the replacement set was in a new box, so I wrapped it up for a Christmas present to my daughter.  When she tried to use it on Christmas morning, we discovered the issue with the microphone not working.  We did all of the troubleshooting steps, but it would not work.  At the time, I still didn't know this was a well known issue with these headphones.

I contacted Amazon, and they had me try a couple more troubleshooting steps, but it still did not work.  At that time, Amazon started the refund process for me.

After that, I was reading reviews, and I saw that several people had the same problem as I had.  One even stated that Sony claims the headset isn't intended to work on a PC, even though their packaging shows how it can connect to both a phone and PC at the same time.

The final chapter of this horrible experience happened today.  I received the refund notice, and it included a $20 restock fee!!

R1CVC6T831LFHY,Wonderful headphones with a fatal flaw.,"I want to love these headphones.  They are light, comfortable, and they sound fantastic.  However they will not stay connected to bluetooth devices.  I have tried multiple devices (S21 Ultra, S23, SteamDeck, Switch, PC) as well as having multi point enabled and disabled.

They frequently drop connection, as often as every 5 minutes.  Sometimes it won't happen for an hour.  And when they work they are the best headphones I've ever used.  But the connection issues make them completely useless.

Having the headphones on the latest firmware and set to prioritize connection in the Headphones app the issue persists.  Having them set to prioritize audio quality seems to cause the issue to happen more frequently but I can't say for sure.  I found threads online recommending a factory reset of the headphones.  That did not resolve the issue.  It is not a range problem as when they are working I'm able to leave my phone in my office and move around almost my entire house without issue.

The disconnects are random and I can not find any correlation with when it occurs.  Often the phone will be in my pocket or on my desk next to me while they disconnect.  When they disconnect the often reconnect automatically.  However when they do they are no longer in ANC mode and music does not auto-resume.

Had I discovered this issue soon enough I would have just returned them and purchased something else.  Now I'm not sure what steps to take.",1,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,the United States

R1BGYN4RUM4J1P,Embarrassment for Sony,"I already own a pair of Sony 1000-XM4's and was looking for a cheaper option with similar features.  Even though these claim to have a similar base price they are not even in the same ballpark.  I don't really understand Sony's logic.  Just lower the price of the 1000's and sell more units of a great pair of headphones instead of selectively dropping features to try to justify a higher price instead of selling a low quality product.  Biggest issue is the volume limiter, there isn't enough range to adjust for sources recorded at low volume.  They also have a very narrow sound stage and flat treble making them sound almost 2 dimensional.  Returning two sets I purchased in favor of a much lower priced alternative.",1,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,Canada
R2S0W039U66C9M,Was impressed….Not so much anymore.,"Update 3/9……so first I’m going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out.  Didn’t realize they were a vine product.  After a few weeks of use the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears.  I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out.  I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I don’t like them riding my jawbone.

I would’ve have overlooked that because they do sound good, however they are now randomly disconnecting.  I use them for YouTube and I’m literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure.  If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad.  When I check the app it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good I don’t think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes.

 Maybe they don’t like Apple devices? I’m not sure….

I originally bought the xm5’s. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them.

I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphone were the solo pro 3’s and I do enjoy them. What I don’t like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on.

I wanted over the ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the xm5’s which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the xm5’s. Yeah, I’m sold so I got them.

Build:
  They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510’s, but nowhere near the xm5’s workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. I’ll be honest….I am wondering how they will hold up.

Comfort:
Excellent. These are super light. I don’t feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But the are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers.

Bells and whistles: these are old school, they have buttons…no swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the xm5’s I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive.

App:  They are part of the Sony Headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad.

Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor based nor is it based on when you device’s screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn of Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better.

Noise cancelling:
I’m going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo pro with ANC I can’t hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the xm5’s were not as good as the Beats. But the on ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So I’ll stick to the xm5’s comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modes…noise cancelling, ambient and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if I’m missing a setting in the app and if something changes I’ll edit my review.

Sound quality: (of course this is subjective to each person) Excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the xm5’s. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasn’t able to change it a bit, I would still be happy.

Other:
They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block.

Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didn’t like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound.  Most were severely lacking in sound quality.  These are not. And they were cheaper.

I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they should’ve done better. To me $150 is alot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticy. And if they crack after 6 months I’ll be upset. I’m not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510’s when they should’ve been a little less than the 910’s. They are far less quality than the 910’s. Maybe I’m asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 pros and xm5’s which both have a superb build.

BUT…..they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking.  They are comparable to the xm5’s in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910’s which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! It’s spot on.

These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,the United States

R36U1PQEZTODKN,"Average at best, SONY's premium price","After much debating on cost to quality ratio between this, XM4 and XM5 (all Sony offerings) and reading tons of reviews here, I settled for this, since it seemed like a balanced option for non-audiophiles. After spending a good amount of time with them, I'm ready to share my thoughts.

First and foremost, let's talk about what Sony has always been known for: sound quality. These headphones do not disappoint in this department. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, delivering a pleasurable listening experience across a variety of genres. The bass can be punchy but not overwhelming, the mids are smooth, and the highs are sharp without being piercing.

Now, onto the aspect that was a bit of a letdown: the active noise-cancelling. The ANC is, to put it bluntly, below average. This is surely a disappointment since I have seen it struggle with noises even at home, including that of fan. Forget, if you TV on or anything, you would be able to hear all of those noises (though slightly suppressed). I have had ANC over ear headsets before. However, cross checking between this and them, I did feel this does perform slightly better, but that said, yes, dont expect the world to silent by any means. I also found that, though the headphones are light and comfortable, you will definately sweat in them and feel your ears burning after sometime, esp during summer and humid places.
Another point worth mentioning, is I found, which i tilt or move my head, the ANC gets disturbed and you will occasionaly for split seconds notice background noises before ANC resumes again.

The build quality of the headphones is solid, with a design that's sleek and minimalistic, and they are comfortable enough for long listening sessions (except summers maybe!). The battery life is also commendable, easily lasting through a full day of use. There is no case, so take good care of them!

Multidevice works good and decent. There could be lags. I have noticed the headsets dont auto switch off (maybe during mutipoint connect).",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,India
RLH3EZDF5H3QZ,Great for listening to music - but nothing else.,"If you're looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to listen to music with or take phone calls while you're not listening to music, these are fine! No complaints! But if you plan to use them for phone calls AND music simultaneously, for zoom or discord, or if you just want to use them as headphones and have a better quality mic for your input - pick different ones. Unfortunately my planned primary use for headphones was to plug into my Blue Yeti mic, and these headphones have a feedback feature that you cannot disable, leading to me hearing a constant split-second delayed echo as both the headphones AND my mic give their individual feedback. Alright, so maybe I could bring them to work and use them there - no dice. For some reason, they immediately mute my music as soon as I join a call.",3,B0BS74M665,2024,the United States
R25S6KQTUMYFFA,"Almost worth it, lots of issues with connectivity","Had to return this FYI.

Pros:
1. Lightweight
2. Sound quality very well for price
3. Affordable ANC

Cons:
1. ANC is decent at best, you can still hear everything around you, just a little less.
2. Lot's of connectivity issues, esp with PC. While connected with AUX headphones picks up lot of static noise, which amplifies 10x while AUX+ANC.
Confirmed with 3 different laptops.

For some reason, my windows 10 laptop had issues differentiating with these and my mouse. When connected with BT, mouse kep freezing every 2s. Apparently windows thought mouse click was actually a headphone button. It got super annoying with issues in both BT and with AUX.

Returned, unfortunately. Will probably go with XB910.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2024,India
R3R3Z49USAU3NE,Sony model WH-CH720N headphones.  They were very good when they worked properly.,"I liked these Sony model WH-CH720N headphones, but the sound cancelling function cut in and out since the day they arrived.  I just didn't notice it until I mowed the lawn.
When the sound cancelling feature worked, it worked as well as my more expensive Bose headphones, which I love, but wore out after 3 years of heavy use.
I have been looking for headphones to replace my Bose.  The Bose were not worth the cost, the Sony malfunctioned, and a pair of Anker Soundcore I purchased wouldn't take a charge after about two weeks.
The Sony headphones were light, comfortable, sounded fine, and the noise cancelling was very good when it worked.
I'll keep hunting.  Beats maybe.
As an aside, I love my Sony earbuds, and really miss my Bose headphones!",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2024,the United States
R2WBN2JISE1R3I,"Not worth the money, only buy if you want great sound quality and call experience","Review after two months. (wanted to wait for some time to avoid break-in problems)

I could go on and on about how this has not been a good investment regarding gadgets, but I'll restrict myself to the pros and cons.

Pros.
1. Great sound quality - lives it up to its name. Hands down.
2. Great battery life - It lasts comfortably for 4-5 days when I keep it on or use it continuously for long working hours.

Cons
1. Comfort - Not comfortable for me, it does not hold on and straightaway engulfs the ear causing direct contact with the speakers. Causes a pinch many times. Also, the ear puffs get sweaty. Hence not comfortable. I hardly can wear it continuously for more than 40-50 minutes. 4/10
2. Noise cancellation - I have tried multiple earbuds before and a Realme 3k earbuds have the same or a little better cancellation than this one. Bummer. would rate it 6/10
3. Connection - I know this would be a big ask, but it stays connected for a long time even when its idle (such as being on overnight) which means you miss switching it off. 7/10
4. I have some disconnection issues when it is connected to multiple devices, which is manageable but not cool.

I am a big Sony fan, trust me ( I have bought a different Sony product at least 6 times, due to its build, and quality). but this did not live up to the mark. There is no refund policy. There is an exchange policy but its time taking and futile. Regret spending so much for average, uncomfortable headphones was a bad call for me.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,India
R29A9YQE18KWYJ,Better options for the price,"These sony headphones are exceptionally light, almost to the point they feel cheap. I have to fly a lot for work and was looking at replacement options for mySoundcore Q45’s. Compared to the Soundcore the Sony headphones felt cheap. The padding around the headphones on the Sony uses a more “breathable” fabric, ear cuffs have a mess fabric, compared to the Soundcore which uses pleather. On long flights the Soundcore headphones can start to feel clammy.

Other issues I had, these are personal preference but ended up being reasons I stuck with my Soundcore Q45’s.

Audio control notifications - On the Q45’s anytime you change the setting normal, transparent, or ANC (Active Noise Canceling). There is an audio message that plays. This is helpful during travel where you find yourself needed to hear a little more. For example, when I am seated on the plane I have ANC on, but if I go to the bathroom I will change to normal which will reduce the noice but allow me to hear more clearly in case someone like the stewards need to pass by. The Sony headset does not have that feature, in order to know what setting you’re in you need to have your device or memorize how many times you hit the settings button.

Sound - The Sony headset sounds better with no ambient noise. Unfortunately do to it’s poor ANC you have go turn the volume up in order to hear clearly. When I am on the plane the idea is to reduce ambient noise. Planes or known for being loud and causing hearing damage when exposed for long periods of time. In the case of the Sony headphones I have to turn them up significantly louder in order to hear. Defeating the purpose I bought them for (reducing noise to hear better).

Finally Sony’s app leaves much to be desired. You have the option to change your mode: normal, transparent, ANC. And that’s about it. They have some software that is supposed to adjust noise based on your ear and boost base but they seemed more of a gimmick then a feature. Sony does not allow you to adjust any of the settings for how strong the ANC is or what frequencies get passed through in transparent mode. On the Soundcore App, you can adjust how strong the ANC is 1-5. For transparent or Normal mode you can adjust frequencies responses. What this does is allows you to customize the filters. In my case I filtered out low frequencies on the plane. I don’t want to hear the rumble of the engines. This allows the high pass frequency to be passed through such as voices.

Sony has good Noise Cancelling headphones at the high end. Unfortunately this mid-high-end ($160) is not one of them. There are better options for less money. I compared to the Q45’s as they are the most comparable in terms of price I have tried and are currently my go-to during my travel. These feel and perform like sub $100 headphones not $160.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,the United States

RB87LLDUYASUY,Immersive Sound and Comfort,"I recently invested in the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts. As an avid music lover and someone who appreciates a good pair of headphones, these have quickly become my go-to choice for a premium audio experience.

1. Comfortable Ear Coverage:

One of the standout features of these headphones is the generous size of the ear cups. They provide excellent coverage, enveloping my entire ears in a cocoon of sound.

The freedom of movement that wireless functionality offers adds to the overall convenience of these headphones.

5. Crisp Sound Quality:

Of course, none of these features would matter if the sound quality wasn't top-notch. Fortunately, the WH-CH720N delivers crisp and clear audio across various genres. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, providing a rich and detailed listening experience.

6. Enhanced Experience with the Headphones App:

R2POMI5PGBQPLX,"Best Headphones I Ever Owned, Especially for the Money","I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.

These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.

I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.

The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.

There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.

Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.

My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.

But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,2023,the United States

The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

RV11P6NKYRGUC,Save your money,"I don’t know what’s happened to Sony over the past 10 years, but they’ve gone from being my absolute favourite consumer audio company to being more of a disappointment than when my parents told me I was adopted.

These headphones are comfy and easy to set up but that’s where the positives stop. The app’s EQ doesn’t has the frequency options limited to frequencies that are mostly not useful, so it’s impossible to make these things sound good. They’re light, sure, but they feel like the headphones you’d find in a mass call center on a tight budget.

R18GGLQIZ1I0L1,"Comfy and lightweight, forget about noise canceling though","They are comfortable to wear for a couple of hours without problem.
I expected the noise canceling to revolutionize my way of doing things but it’s actually pretty useless in an environment where noise levels vary (walking in traffic, people talking, etc.) It works mainly for continuous background noise like the AC or a fan running. In traffic, it’s actually better to turn it off because it will amplify certain sounds instead of canceling which is quite unnerving.
 I still use them and enjoy them at home or at work. The double pairing works really well and provided you are in a quiet environment, the mic pickup during calls is quite good. Again, noise canceling is just bugging when sounds vary too much.

R3ISCNH1T7THU8,Disappointing,"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is disappointing, at best, on several fronts. I purchased these headphones based on long research of technical reviews consistently giving it high ratings and other's comments but in the end, these headphones do not deliver.

1. It does not cancel out other's speaking around you well enough with noise cancelling turned on. I get that it shouldn't be total cancellation. However, when taking a phone call, the people on the other end can hear people in the background clearly, making out what they're saying, while I barely hear them and come across muffled.

2. People complain about the call quality of my voice. They report it comes through with static and dropouts.

3. The headphones rarely connects to devices or its app when powering up  and the app drops its connection frequently. Having previously paired the headphones with two devices (iPhone 15 and various PCs), the headphones very rarely connect to those devices after powering up and almost never with the app. The only way to resolve this is by repeatedly cycling the power on the headphones until the devices and app connect. I've played with rebooting the iPhone and PC thinking something was wrong with those devices but that doesn't help. It's always with the headphones themselves. And then the app will spontaneously drop.

4. Music won't resume or playback through the headphones with speak-to-chat turned on. With speak-to-chat turned on and playing music then speaking, the headphones stop the must playback, which is as expected. However, after now one is speaking and the required delay, the headphones reengage but the must doesn't continue. Pressing play on the music app, the music restarts but the sound doesn't go through the headphones. You have to reboot the headphones, fiddle with getting it to connect to the devices and app (point #3 above) and then maybe the music will playback through the headphones.

The sound quality is great along with the configuration of the settings and actions based on location, the rest is not.

All of this disappointment after ~310 hours using the headphones, according to its app.",1,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
R1EJOO0ITZ26YQ,Sony WH-1000XM5: A Disappointing Downgrade,"I recently purchased the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, and it's safe to say that I am incredibly disappointed with this latest iteration. As a previous owner of the WH-1000XM4, I was expecting a substantial improvement, but the WH-1000XM5 feels like a step backward.

First and foremost, the sound quality is a real letdown. Sony claimed to enhance the audio experience, but it's hard to tell the difference. The bass is muddy and overpowering, while the midrange and treble lack the clarity and detail I was hoping for. It's a far cry from the audio quality I expected from a premium headset.

The noise-canceling feature, which Sony is known for, seems weaker than before. Background noise seeps in, making it far less effective in noisy environments. This is a significant problem for a set of headphones in this price range, as noise cancellation is one of the primary selling points.

Comfort has also taken a hit with the WH-1000XM5. The ear cups are shallower and less comfortable than those of the previous model. I found that extended listening sessions became increasingly uncomfortable, and the fit seemed less secure.

Sony's app, which was a standout feature in the previous model, has also seen a downgrade. It's now clunkier, and the user interface is less intuitive, making customization and updates more frustrating than they should be.

Battery life, touted as a strong point, also disappointed me. It falls short of the claimed duration, and I found myself needing to recharge the headphones more frequently than expected. It's a real inconvenience for travelers or those who rely on these headphones for long journeys.

In conclusion, the Sony WH-1000XM5 is a major disappointment, especially for someone upgrading from the previous model. The audio quality, noise-canceling, comfort, and app functionality have all been downgraded, and I felt let down by this ""upgrade."" For the high price point, I expected more, and I would strongly advise potential buyers to consider alternative options before investing in these headphones.",1,B0BXYCS74H,2023,Canada
R90WPLUQW6RMI,Such a disappointment. My XM2s are much better.,"Such a disappointment. My XM2s are much better.

These sounds a LITTLE better, not that much. Not enough to make up for the XM2's better headband, better ear cup material, better ANC functions, & WAY better ruggedness.

I have honestly abused my XM2s & even after 7 years of every day wear they are solid.
Just now, in 2024 is the ear cup material beginning to crack a bit but that's after countless hours/ days/ weeks of wear doing everything from relaxing, to gaming, to working out, doing yard work, felling trees, playing sports.
Tons of drops, sometimes poor storage, taking hits from footballs, sweat, rain, etc.
The XM2s are awesome.

Within 1 month, I could tell the XM5s just wouldn't cut it.
They easily slip off your head when you're active.
The ANC function is annoying & didn't seem to keep as much sound out.
Sony straight up warns you that ""these cannot get wet. Avoid sweat""
You can't sweat in these bro!?! What?!
Just terrible.

I'm gonna try a different brand until Sony makes some major changes with the XM line.
Good luck everyone. ",1,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States

R1IWSHUDAYW1CU,Only lasted eight months,"These headphones barely lasted eight months before the ear cup broke. I had taken them out of their carry case and was pulling down the cup to make it fit head when it broke. It's not good when something this expensive won't last even a year of routine workday usage.

The ear cups are also pretty shallow so if you wear hearing aids, as I do, you'll find that the headphones can press against your ear enough to cause sore spots if you try to wear them throughout a normal workday. For an high-price item with such a reputation these headphones have been a disappoint. I'd suggest trying other models or brands and skipping these unless you really like the Sony hype about them.",1,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States

So far…YES! Still checking in on battery life. And geeezzz,  Sony, when fully charged couldn’t you make the light change from …ummm, what is that (orange?) supposed to be RED maybe) to GREEN?  Nope light just disappears when charged. I’ve been in the sound industry for 40 years and I can confirm that the  phones 1) silence nearly EVERYTHING & 2) sound great.  (Bass is a bit hyped).

R28NACM3F9G60E,Horrible build quality.,Right from the start I hated the fact that the headphones didn’t fold up like others that I’ve owned.

R1RXU1O51RQXAQ,Average headphones,"So I’ve been debating which headphones to get. I’m by no means a ‘sound’ expert, but I’ve been involved with music from a young age so I know a thing or two about sound and what good headphones quality should be when paying more than $300. First impressions of these Sony headphones aren’t great.

Summary review:

1. Good fit and feels comfortable
2. ANC is good, not excellent but good
3. The sound quality is average, and this is why I’ve rated these headphones only 3 stars. Out the box they sound dreadful. I downloaded the app and set the EQ settings to the desired sound, and even then I’m still not able to get the desired sound quality that I like.
4. Definitely not worth the price tag

Sadly I will be returning these and will be trying out the Bose QC Ultra - they have a much better sound quality and side by side reviews are in favour of the Bose from review forums I’ve looked at.",3,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
RMR8RSITTWN5H,"Perfect for noise cancellation, problems connecting with Teams chat","I bought this headset to replace a pair of Bose QC 35 ii I had previously used at work, as the bluetooth kept failing and the sound was starting to have issues.

I've owned the Sony headphones now since the end of Nov 2023, which feels like a decent enough time to give a well informed review of the product.

Pros: Excellent noise cancellation. The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.

Cons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.

The headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.

In sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market.",3,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
R3VUVWSWC0AKOM,Still the best ANC in the world…but at this price we need more,"First of all, SONY’s wh1000 series remains the best in the world at ANC. I’ve owned the mx3 and m4, as well as AirPods Max and Focal Bathys — the mx5 are the kings, slightly beating out the AirPods and mx4.

They’re also very comfortable, and sound quality is good. Connectivity, especially for multi device, is great and works better, for practical purposes, than the AirPods attempts in this area.

Unfortunately, SONY doesn’t seem to be growing along with its competitors in other areas. Principally, transparency with these headphones is bad. The AirPods Max remain best at this — transparency mode is magically the same as not wearing headphones, and the Bathys are almost as good — you can have a conversation while wearing them even with a little noise going on. But the mx5 are just not as good. Thankfully they have the focused attention mode, but this only works when you cup one hand over your right ear. I find I had to take them off quite a lot.

Finally, the build quality is no better than a $50 set of SONY headphones and the material is not special, beyond being an especial fingerprint magnet. The ear-pads are too soft, meaning the speaker is always touching your ear, and they get very sweaty. These headphones will look like trash after a year of commuting.

Music and call quality cannot touch Apple.

Worth the money if you want best in class ANC over anything else and if you crave lightweight and comfort. Air travelers, look no further. But if you demand a lot from headphones, and premium build quality to match a premium price, look elsewhere. These would be a bargain closer to $300",3,B0BXYCS74H,2023,the United States
R3SB3W0QUBGRBC,What was the point?,"I bought these for travelling and was hoping to get an upgrade to my Apple AirPods Pro that were having some issues. They’re lightweight and comfortable, but they didn’t do very much for noise cancellation on the airplane. I could hear the plane buzzing, people talking, and the doors/bins open closing. I tried to use them to help me sleep at night from my partners snoring and I could still hear that. I didn’t notice anything special about the sound quality either.

The case isn’t anything impressive either. I’d think for higher quality headphone, the case would be a little more robust.

 At the end of the day, it was just as good if not slightly better (more comfortable) than my AirPods Pro which I just should’ve spent the money on replacing.",3,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States

R32P9KHEQX580W,"Great at first, then okay while it lasted","I wear noise cancelling headphones pretty much all day. I had the Sony Wh-1000xm3 for years with zero issues and upgraded to this pair in November of 2023. The noise cancelling is much better and I like the auto pause feature when you take them off. However, there were a couple little annoyances. The right ear sometimes gets a scratchy type of sound when moving your head (or even just my heartbeat, weirdly). It's not hair next to the driver, I've checked a hundred times. After looking online, the general consensus is that the driver is hitting the parts around it and causing that. Fun. There's also sometimes popping sounds, which I think is some connection problem.

Now, May of 2024, the right earcup suddenly stopped working, which seems to be a pretty common complaint after looking into it. I could go bug Sony because their headphones stopped working less than a year in and then be without noise canceling for a week+. But I think I might cut my losses and get another brand.

Be warned, they're nice up front and they come with a nice case and all that. But these do not have the longevity of the 1000xm3's.",2,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
RG4GS8TTEFMDX,Comfort and noise cancellation downgrades from previous perfection,"I bought these to replace a pair of 1000XM3's that had fallen apart after a few glorious years of insanely high usage. These have a slightly different design, and look and feel at first glance a bit sturdier. However, I think the new model has regressed a bit. First, they are not quite as comfortable as the previous iterations. The headband is now narrower, so there is less padded material in direct contact with the head. It feels fine at first but becomes irritating after a few hours for me, whereas I could wear the previous model for an entire trans-Pacific flight without issue. Second, the noise cancellation has degraded, I think due to a worse seal. Maybe something has changed with the ear pad material? With the X3's, it was honestly never something I had to think about. With the X5's, I notice, for example, substantially more engine noise on a flight. I found that I can get better performance if I move the cups around a lot, but even then sometimes I can't find a good seal. There also does seem to be software issues, as it occasionally switches modes without any input. Overall, if you are happily using an older version, I would recommend waiting to upgrade as long as possible.",3,B0BXYCS74H,2023,the United States

R1JS47AJOJKY1K,Overall the XM5 are the best,"For some reason I’m obsessed with headphones so here is the most straight forward review to help you out.

Price - They are all expensive, usually in headphones you pay for what you get.

Sound - APM sound better, but you’re not gonna know unless you compare them side by side.  XM5 sound amazing.

Comfort - Super light and really comfortable.  Headband doesn’t bother me at all.  Trick is to expand the headband so it doesn’t rest on the top of your head that much.  APM are too heavy, Bose feel slightly better than XM5.

Features - They are the best you can get.

Controls - Amazing, touch controls work great!

ANC and Transparency - ANC is really good and on par or better than all other brands.  Transparency on APM sound like you’re not wearing headphones, XM5’s transparency is much better than XM4 but do sound electronic, like you can tell it’s coming through the mic.  It’s no APM but 2nd best for sure.

Build Quality and Design - Plastic but that’s a good thing because they are lightweight.  IMO they look better than anything else.

Multipoint Connection - Set it up in the app and you are good to go with 2 devices.  Stop playing on one device start playing on another.  It’s seamless for the most part but sometimes you may have to reload the video or song to get it to play.

Headphones are really subjective to the user.  What I’ve learned is sound quality and comfort matter more than anything.  There aren’t any headphones that are perfect and check all the boxes but the XM5 IMO are the best on the market.",5,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
R20WK709QH8M66,Absolutely amazing.,"I used to own a pair of XM3s for quite a long time. I loved them so much. Bought them at about half the price than these. I wore those suckers out, accidentally broke them cause I'd use them to fall asleep and.. yeah, still worked but not the same. The price point on these XM5s is obviously super high if you know how numbers affect your bank account. I was kinda lucky because everyone I know for the past 3 years just gives me Amazon gift cards for special occasions (birthday, Christmas, etc) After literal years of browsing Amazon and not committing to using gift card money cause nothing sounded worth it, I finally purchased these. And still paid 150 dollars out of pocket. I have to say they are absolutely amazing. The noise cancelling is awesome (like incredibly good), the sound quality is... I pulled up a song on YouTube that I first heard 15 years ago (and still listen to it's not a memory lapse) and I swear I was hearing little details of the song I had never heard before. Comfy, awesome battery life, lightweight but doesn't feel cheap (better not). So short story long, even if I didn't have a slow build up of Amazon gift cards to help out, I would absolutely pay full price for these puppies. I absolutely love them.",5,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States
R16NN9RX85ZWB2,Wonderful Sound - but - Feels Cheap,"Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II.  Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years.  Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision.  Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most.  Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will review them after trials.

Update: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great.",4,B0BXYCS74H,2024,the United States

- When sitting at coffee shop, blocks out almost ALL ambient noise
- Ears don't get hot after wearing for a bit. It does hurt a bit because grip is tight, so I loosen it quite a bit.

Cons:
- On calls, noise cancelling is good but not perfect. Struggles with wind if not in a building.
- Sounds quality is OK. Don't think it's much better than cheaper headsets. So if you're looking for WOW amplified/boosted sound quality, this won't offer that.
- Connection sometimes randomly drops when I take my headphones off my head (with the pause on remove functionality OFF).

R2D95JSE3TO700,Will not enter pairing mode. Ever. Horrible instructions.,"Update: Feb 2024 After having these for about 6 months, I figured out the pairing issue. It's hard to explain but it is done using the Sony Headphones app and disabling the option for connecting to more than 1 device at a time.

New issue - charging. Actually not new, but every now ant then the earbuds just won't charge. You place them in the container, the light turn on and glows green, then shuts off. All the while 1 or both earbuds will be just about empty on battery life. So you have to play the game of removing them from the case, placing them back in the case, over and over. That doesn't work all the time either, so then you need to plug them into a power source and remove/place in the case until you get a solid orange light that doesn't disappear in 2 seconds. It's a pain in the a$$. Especially when you know the case has a full charge and you want to use the earbuds only to find out 1 or both are dead. Huge let down from Sony. Calling their support line, maybe I can get a different pair. These suck.

Maybe I just got a bad set, but these are the absolute most difficult earbuds that I've ever owned. I've factory reset them at least 5 times and have wasted a good 2 hours of my life trying to pair 2 different devices. The instructions to pair a second device are to place the earbuds in the case, leave the lid open, hold the button on the back for 5 seconds. Sounds easy right? Nope. It's not. The buds will not enter pairing mode. Ever. I can connect to the first device, but good luck with the second. One thing I did learn when I was able to get two devices to pair, that one time, was to be sure to disconnect the earbuds from the first device. Besides the over-complicated method of entering pairing mode, I've had the earbuds only connect one bud, on a few occasions. So you'll get 1 bud to connect, and the other is dead. Trying to get them both to turn on was another clunky nightmare and I ended up just factory resetting them. I'm done messing with them, and they're going back to hell where they came from.

UPDATE - If you're using the ""Headphone"" app on an Android and want to connect to ""pair"" with a second device. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON SONY'S WEBSITE. They will only mess up your earbuds and make you frustrated. In the app under ""status"" locate the ""Connected Device(s)"" and tap that. The next screen you'll see a + button on the bottom right. Click that! That will put the earbuds into pairing mode. Good lord they made that difficult. 2.5 hours later I have them paired.",1,B0BYPFNW6T,2023,the United States
R3W27VYGT0Z4KX,Critically flawed for phone calls,"They are fine enough for listening to audio. For the price, however, you expect to be able to make phone calls.

The headphones will pick up every little ambient sound and inject it into your conversation. There is no way to have the noise canceling feature on while talking to someone.

R15JPB02K3IUGI,Does not look like Sony product| Cheap quality,"Hi There,

I'm writing this review after using it for few months and I can say this product does not meet the expectation, I bought this product by seeing the Sony brand and its totally not worth it.

Once connected with one device, doesn't connect with the other one, sound quality is very very poor, noise cancellation is good.

R3K95ZJQRMSVZY,"Sony, do better!  Does not pair – useless instructions & app","This is my second pair of WF-C700N earbuds.  Returned the first pair because I thought they were DOA.  Have an iPhone 14, downloaded the Sony app.  Pairing should be a snap.  Well, about that...

Ran into the same problem with the second pair that I had with the first:  the earbuds won't connect via standard Bluetooth pairing.  The only device that showed up in pairing mode was an unknown device called ""OTBeat"" which would not pair as an audio device. ( I confess I'm not sure that was even these earbuds.). I then tried the Sony app, which 1) looks sorely outdated, circa 2015 design, and 2) failed to find the Sony earbuds.  Also, there were zero signs of life with the hardware: no visible lights on the charging case nor any sound at all out of the earbuds.  It's unlikely both the first and second pair are DOA, so I'll chalk this up to a shoddy app and an equally shoddy Bluetooth connection.

Expected more, expected better from Sony: I have never had any of their products fail to please or just simply work out of the box.  Maybe others have solved this before, but I don't think it's unreasonable to think something as simple as this should work out of the box.  Don't have the time or the inclination to research the fix.

Back these go.  Will look at another reputable brand for this particular need.",1,B0BYPFNW6T,2024,the United States

R33C3IEUMO6VKU,"Not comfortable, cheap feeling, companion app buggy","Not sure how these have such high reviews. They are made out of very light plastic and feel cheap. The plastic case feels like it could break easily with the lightweight lid. The outside surface of the earbuds is one giant button, so get used to accidentally pressing it when you put the earbuds in or take them out. The earbuds are difficult to put into your ears without touching this giant button. When you touch the earbuds you get a echoey sound directly into your ears like they magnify the abrasion sound from your fingers. The case only has a big enough battery for ONE CHARGE of the earbuds, so at max you get 2 charges on the earbuds before having to plug everything in to recharge. The companion app that you install to update firmware or change EQ settings is also buggy and has spelling mistakes, clearly an app that was outsourced to a cheap overseas app developer.

But worst of all they're just not comfortable. Wearing these for more than an hour make my ear canals hurt, and I've tried all 3 sizes of earbuds.

They do sound great and the noise cancelling works well, but everything else is a deal breaker especially at this price point.",3,B0BYPFNW6T,2024,Canada

The push button is very sensitive and keeps being pressed whenever I adjust the buds. Very awkward to grab and place in ears as they are very small but the button very sensitive. Sound quality is good if managed to place the bud well in ear however I really struggle with the fit so the sound is pretty bad. Noise cancelling almost non existent or very week. Annoying ambient sound control making white noise when I don't want it. Definitely don't recommend if you need passive noise isolation or use for sleeping... Also the material feels so cheap!",2,B0BYPFNW6T,2024,Australia
R1MGV1XOWJJUS5,"Decent Sound, ANC Not For Airplanes","These are not bad. They fit my ears well. They are reasonably loud, but they won't be overpowering.

The frequency response is pretty good. The associated phone app gives you some equalizer control that helps, too.

There is some configurability for the buttons. Not completely customizable, as the actions are grouped across numbers of clicks (e.g. 1: pause, 2: next track, 3: previous track are a group). But I like the defaults, anyway.

I also like the tactile buttons. You rarely accidentally push them while adjusting the buds, unlike touch buttons. There is definitely a significant delay for them to respond (I'm guessing a lot of this is waiting to see how many clicks you're going to do to determine which action to take), so the actual mechanical click lets you know you've pressed them.

They did not hurt at all, even on 9-10 hr flights.

And the battery life so far is crazy good. With ANC enabled, they were still about 15% after use for those entire long flights. Without ANC, they were like 80%! (That'll likely change with age.)

But, the ANC is not useful for me. I bought these for airplane travel. A very old set of ANC headphones did wonderfully eliminating the airplane noise. These, not so much. They physically seal well, so they block sound pretty well with no ANC enabled. In the airplane, turning on the ANC changes the sound, but seems to trade one you can hear for another at roughly the same volume. On one 9 hr flight, this was a bit preferable. But it didn't make much difference on the other. They also didn't block crying babies better with ANC than without. However, they were plenty loud to drown out that noise with or without ANC.

The passthrough mode is functional, but poor quality. It lets though the ambient sound, but it somehow boosts actual noise. Airplanes have air blowing all the time. Without the earbuds, you don't really notice it much. But with these in & turned to the monitor mode, the hiss of the air is very loud. But again, it's still functional for listening, even while being annoying.

As mentioned, I bought these for airplane travel. I have Google Pixel Buds that have no ANC. Comparing to these, the seal is better with the Sonys, even though the ANC doesn't do much for airplane noise. And the equalizer allows adjustments that the Google Buds don't. Including the battery life & buttons, I've decided to keep these. But just be aware of the ANC limits.",3,B0BYPFNW6T,2023,the United States

Whether you're a music enthusiast, a frequent traveler, or someone who values premium audio experiences, these earbuds are a wise investment.  Used to just use those 3.5mm headphones.  Then I got into the in-ear earbuds - took some time to get used to, and the ones I got were wireless somewhat (they still had a cable connecting the earbuds).  These were my first pair of true wireless earbuds, and I was not disappointed.  I wish they had some sort of hook to prevent them from falling out of your ears - I've had it happen once.  Used a size up earbud, and it's better, though I am now using the largest supplied earbud, so if they happen to slip again, I might have to resort with 3rd party earbud pieces.  Guess maybe I have larger than average ear canals?  but nevertheless, these earbuds  are pretty comfortable, provide decent sound quality, and have enough juice to be able to operate over my entire work day + commute",5,B0BYPFNW6T,2024,Canada
R2B13J5B42HCX8,First Impressions,"Long time fan of Sony products. Have the WH-1000XM4, WF-1000XM4, and other brands. Just got these this morning and listening now. Pretty happy with sound quality, the Sony app helps as I like a punchy bass and have typical high frequency loss for male adults. Once set up with the app, clear bass turned up almost to max and treble up I’m enjoying the sound. Sounds very much like the WF-1000XM4. Noise cancellation seems similar but need to do more listening in different conditions. Got the XM4 reconditioned and unfortunately the right battery is failing to hold a charge after about a year and a half so got these to satisfy my earbud itch until the XM5 is released. Actually liking the push button as opposed to the touch controls of XM4. Not better, but not worse. A bit smaller which I’m pleased with as I like to sleep with audiobooks on. I can sleep on my side with a soft pillow and not feel very much pressure. Did have them pause as I have the right side on default to pause and skip but only once so far so I don’t think it will be a problem. Contrary to some reviews either side can he configured to volume with the app. I have volume on the left now. Single press notches up, holding lowers volume. Default is to switch between noise cancellation or ambient mode. I have cancellation on most of the time so volume is more important to me. Also saw criticism about them not automatically pausing when removing, not a problem to me as I can easily pause touching the right side button. I also have some QCY buds that were surprisingly good for the price, and Soundcore A40 witch were also a good find, paid $99 but now $79. They’re almost as comfortable as these for bed but protrude a bit further so when sleeping on my side more pressure on my ear than the Sony. So far noise cancellation on the Sony is the best, almost as good as the XM4.
For the price, I think this is a very good alternative to the XM4. Battery life is rated to 7.5 hours and the Soundcore are rated to about the same but by early morning I get a rudely loud charging notification. We’ll see how the Sony last with similar use and update this review later. Overall in direct comparison of the XM4 I’d say these are just about as good but maybe not as broad of a soundstage. If you like Sony or are just looking for a good quality earbud with noise cancellation at a reasonable price these would be a good selection. One major improvement for me is the tips for the buds. I have large ear canals and the memory tips on the XM4 were a huge disappointment, they would not seal in my ears which is terrible for sound quality and noise. I keep all the tips from many earbuds over the years and even with other brands need to dip into them to find larger tips to seal in my ears. Pleasantly surprised the included large tips actually fit me. I included a photo of the Soundcore, QCY, XM4, and the WF-C700N for comparison. The WF-C700N seems to be the most comfortable so far. Slightly smaller than the Soundcore and definitely smaller then the XM4.
So after using these about a month I’m still happy with them. I do have the occasional problem when listening to audiobooks in bed with the buttons for pause or volume getting just a little too much pressure and activating. Fortunately for volume one notch is louder but if you hold it the volume is reduced so at least I haven’t been blasted by max volume. Much as I like Sony products the other buds I mentioned would probably suit most people fine with a lower cost. But they’re not Sony! Still anxiously waiting for the soon to be released WF-1000XM5. Hoping for the lighter weight than the XM4 and the comfort of these with touch controls instead of push buttons. But for a mid-price bud these are still my favorites.

Another update, these are not working for me to sleep with. My left ear gets a little raw spot on the edge of some cartilage. I’m primarily using the Sony WF-1000XM5 )got them 2 weeks ago) and the Soundcore A40 for audiobooks in bed. The headphones until my ears get too hot and the A40’s when I want to lay on my side.
The Sony has some edge or something on it that makes a tiny little sore spot on the cartilage in my ear. Still like them a lot but now using them when I do my indoor cycling. I have a couple big blower fans on me and the Sony blocks out a lot of the noise and are better then the QCY I’d been using. They’re more rounded and I get less wind noise also.
WF-1000XM5 just released, expecting mine Friday. I REALLY hope they don’t irritate my ear the way these do.
So I’d still recommend these. It’s probably just my personal ear shape causing me an issue, no problem on the right side but nobody is perfectly symmetrical…
8/523
Update. Got the XM5 2 weeks ago and loving them. Fantastic sound, lighter than the XM4, better bass, more comfortable. But again the tips don’t fit. Airtight seal is critical on noise cancelling earbuds. The app is the same for The 700’s and XM5 but the 700’s do not have the feature enabled that checks for a seal. I discovered the left bud on the 700’s and the new XM5 just won’t quit seal. I found a hack to make the tips moldable. If you get Sugro glue (kind of like clay) roll a bit up, pull up the mushroom part of the ear tip, take the rolled up piece of Sugro and wrap it around the fitting to the bud, roll the tip back down and now you have a moldable tip. Insert in your ears and make sure they a good seal. You may have to reshape it a bit with your fingers if you work it too much. Once you have a good seal let it set a few hours and now you have a fitted tip. Works with my big ear holes…
I have to reiterate, the 700’s have a very pleasing sound once you get the equalizer and clear bass setting adjusted to your taste. I just finished using them for 4 hours straight on loud during a 2 hour indoor cycling session, walking the dog, and making my lunch. Enjoying music I haven’t listened to for too long. They were comfortable (almost forget they’re in) sound excellent, and just put them away with 50% battery left.

I really think most people would like these and would not be disappointed in any way, especially at the price. The XM5 are better, but to most people probably not $200 better (but I love them too!).
9/22/23 a note about the app and the codecs used. I feel like a dummy now that I finally noticed right at the top in the headphone connect app it tells me on my iPhone it’s definitely using the AAC codec and shows if DSEE is on or not. DSEE definitely improves the sound. Compared the noise cancellation against the WF-1000XM5 and the XM5 do a better job with the 2 blower fans I have on me during my indoor cycling. But I still prefer using the C700n just because I want to be very careful with the more expensive buds.
10/23/23
Lost these! Looked all around but can’t locate. I was able to replace them @ $88 so not hugely upset, ordered a new pair and happy all over again. One of the reasons I really like these is how light they are. Even after 4-5 hours of wear I almost forget they’re in. Still one of my favorite pairs.
Revisiting noise cancellation, walking my dog with light traffic only a few feet away I’ve had the chance with the new pair (left button default is now toggle ANC transparency off or on. With it off I’m not hearing much of anything but my music. In transparency mode I can hear everything around me. I’d give these a 9 from 1-10. About as good as any ANC buds I’ve tried.
12/22/23
Found the lost pair so now I have 2 pairs of the WF-C700n and not unhappy about it. These are definitely my go to buds, use them more than the XM5’s as they’re so light and comfortable and now at $76 I don’t worry as much about loss or damage as with the pricy XM5.

Finally, headphones that are small, fit my little ears, don’t hurt my ears, sound good, are comfortable to wear with a toque…. They were perfect. But now they are terrible. After two months of running with these, the battery now only lasts 20 minutes for the left one and somewhere around 50-70 minutes for the left one. This is after only two months of use. I was running my first marathon last weekend and they died right near the beginning when I still had three hours left to run. I’m so unbelievably disappointed. I’ve written to them for a warranty replacement and that process has been slow as all heck too. It took three business days just to have someone email me to say that I will be getting a USPS mailing label to send them back for review. Well, I’m in Canada so I don’t know if that will work and how long does it take for this label to arrive? It’s going to be weeks before I get this rectified. If I could return them I would. I’m just so disappointed. I’ve had other Shokz in the past and the battery always fails prematurely. I had hoped beyond hope that these would at least last for the duration of the two year warranty period but I barely got two months out of them and they failed at the worst time. Please consider other options. Sadly, I’m looking to find other open ear solutions as these just don’t last. I can’t wait weeks and weeks for a warranty replacement and can’t afford to buy replacements every few months. What a great product with such an unfortunate outcome. Buyer beware.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,Canada
R68UZ5ZMP9E3A,Disappointing on many levels,"I so wanted to love these headphones, as I am a big fan of Shokz and have their OpenRun Pros. Compared to my Cleer Audio Arc II the OpenFit headphones disappoint on so many levels.

The one positive is the size and materials used! They look and feel high quality and are very comfortable! They are small in design and have a really compact carry case, so if size is important then these are great.

On to where they disappointed me . Starting with the most important aspect - Sound quality. They really lack oomph in the bass department. It was muffled on all music styles I listened too. It just lacked depth. They performed better on higher notes and vocals but was still lacking punch. They didn’t have the same immersive sound that you get with the Cleer headphones

Connectivity. Such a shame that it can only pair with one device at a time. It’s not hard to swap between devices but would be better if you didn’t have to. I use my iPhone and watch for music so had to keep connecting to the separate devices each time. Also meant that I could only use the app if the headphones were connected to my phone rather than my watch! So annoying. If I wanted to make any EQ tweaks I would have to log out of my watch, connect to my phone, make the tweaks in the app, log out of the iPhone and then reconnect to my watch! With Cleer you can connect to multiple devices, allowing you to use the app regardless.

I would recommend you spend the extra £20 and go for the Cleer Audio Arc II as they deliver on all grounds and have an amazing sound",1,B0BYSSD56Y,2023,the United Kingdom

R1FPFF2G6JZ6OW,Absolute garbage,"Update Jan 2024
These are now literally garbage. I threw them out from frustration. I tried to make a warranty claim a few months ago, but it was obvious that was going nowhere. After letting them sit since then I decided to pull them out to give them another go. Spent time charging them up. They wanted a firmware update. Oh, but my cellphone is only 25% charged, so it won’t let me. Charge the cellphone. Oh, but only one headphone is connected (while they’re seated as firmly as possible in their case, btw). Re-seat them over and over to no avail. Literally press them into the case and hold them. Literally throw them IN THE TRASH!

I will absolutely positively never ever ever give this company one more cent of my money, and I really hope that you don’t either. They don’t deserve your business.

Prior update:
Downgrading from 2 to 1 stars. Good luck keeping these charged. They appear to stay on even in the case and then they’re dead when you need them.

Original review:
I have a pair of the bone conduction aeropex headphones that I use every day for workouts. I really like them, except for the plastic bands that runs around the back of my head. It makes it tough to wear the headphones more casually. If you want to relax and sit back in a chair you couldn’t.

So, I decided that maybe these would be a nice upgrade. They’re just ok. A couple of observations

1) because they’re no longer bone conduction I worry that I’m having to turn the headphones up too high when there’s background noise, risking hearing damage. Basically, ear buds make more sense here because they block all of that stuff out so you can listen at a lower volume.
2) the “configurable” double tap and tap and hold actions are such sad little implementations. There are only a few different ways that you’re able to configure the soft buttons and they all kind of suck. Want to manage volume? Sure, you can tap and hold the right ear bud to turn it up. It’s awkward to do while running, and it feels laggy and prone to misses. Don’t like tap and hold for volume controls? Well, pull your phone out and use those buttons because there’s not a single other option. The aeropex button setup was so much better to use.
3) I’m really struggling with battery life and it would appear that these have more of a maintenance drain than you might expect. I have also had issues getting them to seat in the case completely enough to actually disconnect from my phone’s Bluetooth. No idea how much battery has been wasted on idling in the case.

These are trash.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United States
R1WL5SE4OM417I,A Great Design Hampered By Annoying “Features”,"These could’ve easily been 5 stars with a few tweaks. The comfort and ease of wearing these headphones is great, and the sound quality is really impressive for the type of headphones that they are. They’d almost be my preferred set of headphones, but some of the execution really makes using these a frustrating experiences.

There are really 2 fundamental issues at play here. First, these headphones are terrible at pairing. After I’m done using them and put them back in the case, they will continuously try to re-pair with my phone even though they’re in the case. Even after repeatedly disconnecting from Bluetooth, they’ll keep trying to re-pair with my phone, which causes passive battery drain inside the charging case constantly. It’s extremely frustrating to be 1 mile into a 9 mile run only to find out that the headphones that were fully charged last night, have actually been connected to your phone and draining for hours without actually being in use.

The second fundamental flaw here is some of the worst touch controls I have ever experienced. You’re able to double tap, or hold down on the bud, but the problem is that anyone who uses them in an active setting (like Shokz were designed for) is likely going to sweat, and sweat can activate the touch controls. So while you’re at the gym, you might all of a sudden find that your headphones just crank up to max volume on their own and blow your eardrums out. Or you’ll be on a hike and in a matter of moments, you’ve skipped 14 tracks ahead in your playlist without any warning. And of course the app lets you customize which features you assign to which controls, but there’s no way to just toggle it off, so you’re stuck just hoping against all odds that your listening experience doesn’t randomly go haywire.

If it weren’t for these two fundamentally broken elements, these headphones would be my daily use. It truly infuriates me how close they are to being excellent, because these two issues really ruin the experience.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2024,the United States
R2HTUILLF31990,not at all satisfied and totally different than I was expecting,"I bought this product in the perception that I have been satisfied with Shokz for years. But I should have done more research, therefore this review to connect the dots anyway.
First important point: these are NOT boneconducting earphones. I repeat: none! Whereas Shokz makes all their other products boneconducting, that is not the case here at all.
What they do here are actually ordinary earbuds like they did 10 years ago (not in-ear, the regular ones), they then didn't stick it in your ear but hung it just in front of it, and then turn up the volume so you can still hear it.
Well, for something like that, it's better to get some cheap brand.
A second important point is that by their operation: hanging a loudspeaker in front of your ear, that they have made the earphones so that there is therefore a distance between your ear and that loudspeaker. This has 2 consequences: on the one hand that you can hear the sound around you, but not well. Because there is simply a physical barrier, you hear it less well. From listening at a normal sound level, I cannot understand anything else from the surroundings. But above all, a dealbreaker for me: you can't use these earphones properly with a bike helmet. The bike helmet puts pressure so that the speaker is pressed up against your ear, which on the one hand makes you hear nothing of the surroundings and on the other hand gives you a headache. Even with a hat I got this unpleasant effect. Was returned.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,Germany
ROSPYGTST2SME,Broke after ONLY 2 months!!!,"Due to not wanting in ear buds, I moved to bone conduction earphones which are great, however the band around the back of the neck sticks out and look and feel cumbersome.
I decided to try these as they wrap around the ear and still allow to hear things around me while running. They do this very well most of the time but you lose the sound when around busy traffic.
They are nice and light which is great though they don't feel super secure and did come off once, when putting hood on due to lightness.
My main concern is when running in the rain with the hood up, the thin fabric causes the touch controls to operate!
Will update if anything else happens 

UPDATE!!....after 2 months, left hand earbud will not charge, I've noticed one of the charging prongs not making connection.
Contacted Shokz but automatic reply states 2 days to respond, 3rd day still waiting with no music.
2nd UPDATE! Shokz replied with copy/pasted fixes as a reply, which can be found anywhere.  I replied telling them I had tried all of them and a further 3 days later they still haven't replied.
Not impressed with Shokz aftersale response or lack of!.

R1DPQGCBS519EL,"Lightweight, good case but what is going on with the base?","Have used several shokz product in the past and really looked forward for these. Love the case it is small compared to many other similar buds, they are light weight and fit really good in the ear - they stay put when you lay down for benchpress or similar (unlike oladance OWS2) - ok battery and really good microphone.

BUT the sound - what is going on here - as soon as there is any base the sound just falls apart there is a grating sound instead of base and the sound level is not that high when this happens.. A lot of youtubers talk about how great these are and I only found ONE that mentioned the bas grating sound.

Go for the 1More Fit s50 instead - save some money but get better sound",2,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,Sweden
R196PP8OMC7A1K,Not recommended due to issues with charging.,"I have used two different shokz bone conduction headphones in the past, starting with the aeropex and most recently had the openrun pro. Keeping my ears open while exercising outside is very important to me and those definitely delivered that. Sound quality however was never a strong suit of them and I found that overtime both started developing excess vibrations or rattling. Most recently the openrun pro has started vibrating a lot after some time of use while exercising, potentially from sweat between the driver and my skin. I also found them super comfortable to wear, but since both sides were connected, they were exactly compact.

I only have a short time with the openfit, but I think I have a decent idea of some of the pros and cons as compared to the openrun pro.

Pros:
- Sound quality. Its a noticeable improvement over the openrun pro. Bass actually exists with these. Its still not top tier, but for an open ear product, I think its pretty good.
- Still open ear. While it covers your ear a bit more it doesnt seem to block out much if any sound. Situational awareness seems to be just as good as the openrun. Obviously if you need isolation, these are not for you.
- TWS. These are much smaller and more compact than the openrun since each ear is separated. Still have ear hooks, so I think they will be stable without any worries about losing one or the other.
- Charging case. Having a compact case to carry them around with and provide extra battery life is nice.
- USB C. The charging case charges via usb-c instead of a proprietary connector with the open run. No more worrying about having to bring a special cable.
- Comfort. They are very comfortable to wear and very lightweight. No more loop around the back of your head getting in the way of things.

Cons:
- Comfort. Also a con since part of it has to actually protrude over your ear canal and its been more noticeable while wearing them while I could pretty easily forget that I was wearing the openrun pro. I expect I will get used to them, but I do find it a step down.
- No multipoint. I use these with both my phone and my watch, and now have to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices. The openrun pro had multipoint and while my watch sometimes had issues connecting, I at least never had to manually go into pairing mode just to switch between devices.
- Controls. There are touch controls on each earpiece. They can be customized which is nice, but by default volume control isnt enabled, and can only be enabled on long press, which is 3 seconds. It feels very long to hold down for 3 seconds for volume. Also due to the way they sit on the ear, it kind of puts pressure on the ear to press or tap these controls. The openrun pro had dedicated volume buttons and a dedicated play/pause button. I much preferred that. The openrun pro could also be turned on or off with the controls, cant do that on the openfit. Seems placing them in or out of the case is the only way to turn them off or even disconnect the bluetooth without disconnecting it from your phone or other device.

I of course havent used them long enough to see how they hold up over time. But I expect since creating sound isnt based on vibrating against your head, quality should hopefully hold up and not start vibrating as both of my previous shokz products have through use. The sound quality improvement while still being open and keeping situational awareness is really nice.

I havent tried phone calls with them yet, but I imagine they would be just as good as the openrun pro's which were great for that.

A lot of good upgrades and overall I think the form factor could prove to be a lot better. But there are some noticeable steps back, so I am settling on 4 stars because the cons are enough for me to prevent a full 5. The app does allow for firmware updates though, and there was one available as soon as I turned them on. I imagine multipoint could conceivably be added (if the hardware supports it) or the controls could be further tweaked or expanded upon.

Update 8/23/23 - Lowering to 3 stars. All the positives from above remain. The size is nice, they are compact. They sound good, especially compared to the openrun. Still have all the same situational awareness.

But I find myself adjusting them quite often when using them. I have never had either side fall out while exercising, but they still dont feel as secure as the openrun ever did. They can bounce around just slightly when using them.

I also find call quality doesnt seem to be as good when paired with my phone. Still quite usable, but not as crisp or clear as others.

There have been a couple of firmware updates so far, but nothing that has allowed for more customization of the touch controls. A swipe motion to change volume like other tws earbuds have would be very welcome as an additional control. And the long press is still obnoxiously long.

But the biggest issue is that I have started developing trouble charging one of the earbuds. It doesnt seem to reliably make contact with the charging case anymore. I use them pretty much every day, but I do feel like I may not be getting near the advertised battery, and find myself having to charge the case seemingly once a week, even though there is no way I am using them for nearly 30 hours a week. Might be an issue of the actual earbuds not seating or charging properly.

And since the charging case is needed both to disconnect the openfit from my phone or other device and is needed to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices (since they have no multipoint), it has made them more and more difficult to use. I have had multiple instances where I cannot properly activate pairing mode to switch devices and have to try multiple times before it works. I Even had one night where I put them back in the case, but they never actually registered in the case so they just remained on and draining theirs and my phones battery overnight.

I do not know if this is just from poor design or potentially from some stray sweat after working out with them, but if its the latter, these are advertised as water resistant and to be used for ""sport"" so this would seem like a possible failure point or issue. And I feel like now I am going to have to go through the hassle of getting a warranty replacement for a product.

Update 8/28/23 - Back to 4 stars. The right earbud completely died on me and I could not get it to charge in the case. Though somehow I eventually managed to get it to charge again, and it seems that it is charging somewhat consistently again. I still sometimes have to reseat it or wiggle it to make sure its actually registered as being in the case.

But the real reason I am back to 4 stars is because the latest firmware added multipoint. 2 devices can now be connected. And it seems to work pretty seamlessly. So I am quite happy with that. Weirdly it doesnt look like they have updated their product pages with this yet.

I cannot tell if anything else has been changed with the latest firmware update as I cannot find any patch notes. The long press delay seems like it might be slightly shorter than before, but its still quite long. There wasnt even any mention of multipoint other than a new setting for it just appeared in the app after the firmware updated.

At this point I think these would be 5 stars for me if they were able to update the gestures. Based on some other TWS I have used, single tap and swipe gestures are not available. And given the larger area of these, a swipe at least seems like it would be the best for volume control. Not sure if its possible with the hardware, and maybe the single tap was left out to prevent false activations while working out. At the very least, the long press still seems like it could be shortened.

Update 3/4/24: Dropping down to 2 stars. I don't recommend these anymore. The replacement pair I received a while back after an annoying RMA process with spotty communication from shokz has now started to exhibit the same behavior the first pair exhibited.

The right earpiece again is having issues charging properly on the charging case. It does not seem to make a solid connection in the case anymore. Not only does this mean that it doesn't always charge properly, but even worse the charging case is used to essentially turn them off. This means I can put it in the case and if I am not super careful, it will remain on, will not charge, and remain connected to my phone. I have now had multiple times where after a day I go to use them and the right earpiece is nearly dead. If this progresses as before, eventually it seems likely that the right earpiece won't be able to take a charge at all.

Since this has happened again, and again to the right side, this feels like there must be some issue with these.

The only thing I can think of is that I do use them when exercising and I do sweat, and have occasionally used them out in some light rain. But with an IP54 rating I assumed this shouldnt be an issue as this seems exactly like what that rating is designed for. I always wipe them dry before putting them in the charging case.

I will be reaching out to support again to see what my options are and likely start looking for a replacement.",2,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United States
RCVYLFIFLL0V9,They are Bamboozling you,"So, I bought these back in… April of 2024? Late April. I love to hike, but many of the types like these are too big for my head, and they slide. I figured these headphones would be the answer.

They were easy to connect, seamless to listen to. I loved them. Within the first 4 hours, I was excited by the lightweight feel, the sound quality, and how I forgot I was using them. They died shortly after that 4 hours, but what was I to know? I didn’t charge them initially so my bad. I was impressed, and I charged them.

I let my partner use them on one of their bike rides, and was surprised when he told me that he didn’t like them for various reasons, namely the same reasons I got them in the first place, but went on to say how they died fast. I was surprised as the battery life is one of the reasons I got this item. Still, I charged them.

I used them again to help do housework, sometimes go on little walks. I’ve never gotten more than 4 hours. Added into this is that they don’t automatically connect, disconnect frequently from Bluetooth and have a poor range of connection. I contemplated returning them, only to realize I missed the return by day and don’t know where all the packaging is.

I don’t typically leave reviews, and If I do, it’s that the thing either amazed me or disappointed me so severely, I don’t want others to repeat my mistake. So I’ll say it this way: for almost 2 months of ownership, they’ve become such a waste to me that I’ve used them maybe 10 times and have been opting to use my phone’s speaker instead. I feel bamboozled that the product promised such good things, and the reviews were good, that I bought it. I wasted this money on subpar consumerism.

 Would never purchase again, and look forward to bequeathing them to someone else’s temporary urgency some day.",2,B0BYSQDWRT,2024,the United States
R3L9A40H66XB68,I so wanted to like these!!!!,"I decided to splurge on an over the ear pair of ear pods, and after looking at reviews and video's (You Tube) I decided to give these a try.  I was so excited when they arrived, and then I put them on.  The left ear fits PERFECTLY!!!!  But no matter what I tried to do, the right ear does not align correctly.  Without correctly fitting, you can't really gauge a pair of ear pods for noise cancellation.  I tried to tweak the bend in the right ear pod, but it is too rigid to allow for any 'give'. I read everything that came with the ear pods, and searched online, and after reading everything I could find, I determined that I have an 'odd shaped' ear, at least for these ear pods.  I have several other pairs (mostly in the price range of $20-$50), and they all fit perfectly, and I have a pair of SoundCore Sport 20's (I wish I would've bought a second pair of these so that between the 2 they would last all work day), but I thought I needed these.  They are going back to Amazon for a lousy fit, and I'll not buy another pair.  I can't be the only person with differently shaped ears!!!!!  Lousy, lousy product, and the price point is pretty steep for poor fitting device.",2,B0BYSSD56Y,2024,the United States
R1TPLHIPAN4DPO,Bulky and cumbersome,"So I own the other products that are bone conducting headphones and I love them. That being said, I am well aware that It is my fault for being excited when sane these  for being excited when seeinh these headphones in automatically thinking they are bone conducting and will leave my ear open. When I receive these and saw that they were not what I thought I was slightly disappointed but decided to give them a try anyways. The design is white bulky especially the little bit and that's supposed to go behind your ear and tuck away. I do wear glasses and that compounds on top of help will be they are so I decided to try them with and without my glasses. After multiple attempts on giving these a chance I had to return them the same day that I received them which now I have to wait 30 days for a refund so keep that in mind. These slightly hover over your ear to pump volume into them however I did find them white irritating with any seven movements or the slight vibration I would receive from them which felt like I had a bug crawling around on my ear. They wouldn't stay snug no matter what I did even following the video tutorial instructions to see if I was doing something wrong. The end that goes into your ear is also quite large and bulky and I'm not a small guy. The photos that they use to market this are definitely deceptive and making them look smaller there are other products I didn't really have this much of an issue but I was hoping for single year bone conducting so I wouldn't have a band on the back of my neck. They might be for other people but these are definitely not for me because they don't stay put they awkwardly vibrate on top of your ear and they are much larger than you think they should be.

R2BM7ZH35BY0HU,They're alright,"They work fine, the audio is decent for what they are. The bass isn't very good at higher volumes. The battery life is very good, the earbuds last upwards of 7 hours and the case recharges them very quickly. They're very portable, I like the concept of being open fit so you can hear the environment around you. The left ear fits well and gives good audio, but I find the right ear bud doesn't quite sit right. It's hard to adjust it to get it to sound right, and whenever I get it to sound right it's loose and shakes out pretty easily. Since it doesn't sit right, it's hard getting equal sound from them. The microphone is decent, but sounds a little washed out.
Feels good quality and seem durable. They work as advertised and are decent, but I think they're overpriced. I would say $80 would be more of a fair price for them, at the price I don't believe they're worth it. I'd recommend trying them out in a store and seeing if they're right for you before you buy them.",2,B0BYSQDWRT,2024,the United States
R2QBMZ55EPD2K0,"I wanted to like these so much, but they fall short for a simple reason","The reason I like bone conductive headphones is because I can maintain situational awareness. I've love my openrun and aeropex by aeroshockz/shocks for years. So I've finally caved to try the buds style head phones, since I once made fun of someone who lost an ear bud on the plane ""you know it would be really cool if they connected those together somehow, maybe some day""

The open run battery lasts all day in standby/calls/music, but these need to be popped in the charger case frequently. This means before I could be ready to answer a call simple by pressing the multifunction button sunup to sundown, but now when they get low on battery, there's often times where I have to say ""hold on, let me get my headphones on"" completely stupid.

The other dealbreaker for me is the ""gesture"" selection is a joke. I want to be able to QUICKLY change the volume up or down. DO YOU HEAR ME PROJECT MANAGER AT SHOCKZ THAT DECIDED TO USE THE CURRENT FEATURE SET? I want to QUICKLY  change the volume.
With the open run, the hardware volume is intuitive so when someone is talking to me, I can reach back and turn down the volume within .5 Seconds clicking rapidly, and just as easily backup. With these stupid buds I have to press and hold the  button area and let it step up or down until it gets to my momentary volume need. Then I have to do the same to turn it back up. If I choose to use volume control, I then have to choose between skip track, play/pause and assistant app among other useful features, which ultimately makes it worthless than the multifunction button of the openrin/aeropex.

- Very lightweight
- Stable when seated
- Impressive sound for no in-ear
- Solid bass
- Minimal sound leakage

Cons
- Pairing to a different, previously paired device still requires entering pairing mode every time.  Even after just two days this gets quite annoying.  Other bluetooth earbuds I have remember multiple devices and can effortlessly reconnect.
- Out of the box I noticed a lot of crackling sound at higher volumes. Installing a software update helped significantly alleviate this.
-  When active (shooting a basketball, not playing a full game) these don't stay well positioned.  I had to stop and adjust the earbud to reestablish a solid sound.
- Touch controls feel unintuitive and awkward. You can program controls via the Shokz app but I much prefer physical buttons to touch controls. ""Double tap on a specific region of the earbud"" has felt like a poor design. It also shifts the earbud so you have to readjust to reestablish quality sound.

R3OW3JDR66XSMM,Nice headphones but I need to hear what's playing,"My biggest issue with the device is simply volume. While they fit reasonably well and the battery life is what you might expect, there have been occasions where I just can't hear the content against ambient sound.
I've used these for audiobooks; your needs might be different. I have a pair of other Shokz headphones and those allow me to hear what's being said. These do not.
Battery, comfort and general audio quality is fine. But, of course, there's the consideration of using these headphones while moving about. I've had to - these are sports headphones after all - adjust the fit on occasion while going for one of my walks. Well, touch the 'touch panel' on the side while doing so and it's paused or some other function that simply interrupts the rhythm. I do understand: they're sealed against sweat, rain, etc but that does mean that physical buttons take a back-seat to touch controls and the annoyance is palpable.

RPGQV0K96BXWK,Faulty charging,"I was super excited to buy these open earphones from Shokz, I have used their bone conduction headphones for years and absolutely love them. They were super comfy and had great sound quality, an improvement on the bone conduction ones. However,  sadly the pair I received were faulty as regards to the charging, the left earphone worked as advertised but the right earphone wouldn't hold it's charge and only worked for a couple of hours before turning off.

I contacted Shokz customer support to report the fault and requested a replacement pair. They suggested I return them through Amazon returns and offered me a 15% voucher towards another pair if I wished to re-order. Unfortunately the 15% discount merely reduced the current purchase price to the price I paid for my original purchase in the sale so not much of a 'goodwill gesture' in my opinion.

FIT 6: I found them to be a little loose to fit and I had an experience after one day where they fell off and also nearly got damaged by a passer by. I would have liked they fit a little more tighter. They don’t also sit directly over the ear and I felt they off for me to get the full effect of sound. I guess we are all built different though.
SOUND 5: fairly good but I had replaced a cheaper product that gave me more much better sound. This is a big fail as this is the purpose of the product. Also no external sound reduction for the user and only for callers. Although I have not used for calls.
FEATURES 6: work well so I don’t thing any issues here and the app gives control to offer custom set sounds or create your own.

RO5G90PK3KM2Q,Clean Sound and Comfort (in contrast to the competition),"I don't often write product reviews, but felt that my experience with the Oladance OWS Pro and Shokz OpenFit might be helpful to others. I pre-ordered the OWS Pro on the day of release and my initial impression was great. They have excellent sound quality and are a truly beautiful design. However, after a week of usage I ended up massively disappointed, and regrettably had to return them - I purchased the Shokz OpenFit instead and am much happier. My use case is for podcasts, audiobooks and quiet music in a home office environment.

Unfortunately My OWS Pro had an annoying rapid 'ticking' sound that was constantly there quietly in the background when any audio was active. I could best describe it as the sound an old film projector makes. It wasn't audible in a noisy environment or with loud 'busy' music, but in a quiet home office with podcasts, phone calls, notification sounds, quiet music or music with silent portions, and - ironically enough - their 'Focus Mode', it was constantly apparent. I'd call it a constant hissing/ticking/clicking background sound when any audio stream is active. For example a notification sound would be 'hiss-ticktick-hiss-ticktick&lt;notificaton sound>hiss-ticktick-hiss-ticktick' as the audio circuitry activated and deactivated. I tried it with three different devices. I contacted Oladance support and they told me, and I quote: ""The low-level hissing/ticking/clicking sound audible in the background you mention may be white noise, and we'd like to explain to you that white noise is a common problem with all speakers and headphones; it is generated when electronic devices operate. It is a normal phenomenon, not the quality problem of the headset itself, so there is no need to worry"". Laughably, some reviewers actually excuse this white noise by describing it as a 'noise cancelling' feature.

Absolute nonsense. So after a little research I purchased a pair of Shokz OpenFit instead, as several serious YouTube reviewers noted them for their very low 'residual noise' (the OWS and the Cleer Arc II were rated the worst). The OpenFit has absolutely NO hissing or background static - just a clean pure audio stream - a notification sound is just a notification sound, nothing else is audible. Shokz deserve to be applauded for this.

Additionally the OpenFit's comfort and lightweight design is second to none (and I wear glasses).  The battery life of the Oladance also gave me problems (left earbud sometimes only charging to 70% and running out much faster than the right). The Shokz by comparison, despite only being rated for 7 hours, have got me through the day (and the battery case is smaller anyway so can more easily be carried with you).

I have no doubt the OWS Pro are a great set of headphones for many use-cases, I was initially wowed by them, but for me they proved a major disappointment - despite their excellent audio quality. In addition, the controls proved fiddly and unreliable. I realise they've gone the push-button route for those using them when exercising, but in comparison I've found the OpenFit touch-style controls more reliable and easier to use.

I hope my experience proves helpful for you in making a purchasing decision for your use case. I look forward to the next evolution in this product-space as it is rapidly expanding, but I'll be putting Shokz top of my list when buying my next pair - based on this experience I feel they can be better trusted to produce a quality product.

UPDATE: Just spent an afternoon sitting in the sun listening to some favourite old tracks on these and have upped my rating from four stars to five. Very happy with the purchase.

UPDATE 2 (10/02/24): I just tried a pair of Soundcore Aerofit Pro as they had some attractive features the Shokz do not (longer battery life, LDAC support, detachable headband, on/off switch). Although these features were all desirable, I ultimately returned the Aerofit Pro and kept the Shokz OpenFit. The reason was simple: sound quality. The Shokz have a fuller, more expansive soundstage, and much better bass. Although the AeroFit Pro do indeed have a very clear sound with the LDAC codec, it is more focussed on mids and highs and lacks the bass punch of the OpenFit. In a side-by-side comparison I realised that I *enjoyed* listening on the Shokz more than on the Soundcore. The EQ in the Soundcore app also seemed to have very little effect compared to the changes you can make in the Shokz app. If I can put it this way: the AeroFit sounded like a pair of headphones, while on the Shokz my music sounded like how I would expect it to over a pair of speakers. Hoping Shokz bring improvements in the abovementioned features in their next iteration, but despite their lacking in some areas at the moment, they still win out over everything else for me because of the sound.",5,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United Kingdom

I listen to podcasts a lot, and it's so convenient. I find the quality of sound very good and there are adjustments you can make on the app as well.

R2VA2JQAQJNIJQ,"Super comfortable, features exactly as described","I've waited to review until I'd had and used these a good bit to be able to give my honest review and after a month of use I can say that I love these and would absolutely recommend them and buy them again.

I have never found a pair of ear buds that don't cause me extreme pain in my ears, neck, shoulders, and head. I've tried all manner of ear buds, from super cheap to really expensive, and these are the first set of ear buds that I can wear all day without any pain whatsoever. It took a little getting used to the way that they fit because they did sort of feel like they were on the verge of falling out when I first got them, but this is just due to a different design than I've ever experienced and they're actually quite secure and not going anywhere. I do find myself forgetting that I have them on and will walk around with nothing playing, wearing them for hours sometimes. Even as a glasses wearer, I don't find myself having any problems with comfort or secure fit.

The sound quality is honestly the best I've experienced in all of the ear buds I've tried. I'm super impressed with the bass they're able to achieve, and it is sort of a ""sound is in your head"" kind of experience. I've used them for listening to music, watching YouTube, watching TV shows and movies, and have never felt that I needed to adjust the EQ. They really just sound great for all uses, in my opinion.

I love the way that you put them into pairing mode - I did have to look up a YouTube video on how to do it because I struggled to understand the instructions provided, but it's actually really easy and reliable, and one of the easier pairing experiences I've had. I have a few pairs of headphones/ear buds that are a major pain to pair and fall out of being paired randomly, and I've had none of those issues with these.

I haven't had any issues with the touch controls not working right, though I don't use these for running and it seems the majority of reviewers having issues with the touch controls are runners who experience sweat, so that could be why I've had no issues. I'm a stay at home mom who works part time from home and home schools my kid, so my typical use of these is while sitting at a computer working, or while walking around my home doing school or chores.

They're not super noise canceling and they don't have the longest battery life but that is exactly as advertised. Being open ear fit they couldn't possibly be noise canceling (though they do actually drown out most sound pretty well if the volume is up high), which is actually what I need in ear buds as a stay at home mom who needs to be able to hear my kid at all times. I don't want to give these a low review on noise cancellation or battery life because they're clearly advertised as not being noise canceling, and also clearly advertised that the ear buds themselves only have a 7 hour battery life and the case has a 28 hour battery life, so it would seem unfair to lower their rating over something that you're advertised before even buying. Maybe in future models they'll be able to increase the battery life, but until then it is totally fine with me as someone who is home pretty much at all times and able to recharge without issue.

I am super happy with these, and so pleased to have finally found ear buds I can wear without pain. After years of searching, I finally found a pair that works for me and actually sounds great, too.",5,B0BYSSD56Y,2024,the United States
R1JUBHP8G3DRBO,SHOKZ OpenFit Open-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Earphones !,"I ordered these SHOKZ OpenFit Open-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Earphones ( Black ) a few days ago, and I have just received my order Today. ; I will begin by mentioning that I already have a BOSE SoundLink II On-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones, which are my Current favourite Bluetooth headphones. And I also already have the Apple AirPods 3rd Generation Wireless Bluetooth Earphones, which I am also currently very happy with, and they’re great for commuting, travelling, and vacationing with. Sound Quality between the BOSE SoundLink II On-Ear and the Apple AirPods 3rd Generation are both Comparable, and both Excellent. ; I only just got the SHOKZ OpenFit Open-Ear Bluetooth Earphones today, so I haven’t quite had the chance to fully put it through its paces as yet. Like the Apple AirPods, it comes with a wireless charging case, so you can charge the earphones on the go ( while the wireless charging case still holds a charge ). For me, the SHOKZ OpenFit Earphones Fit quite snugly, steadily, and very comfortably around my ears without any discomfort. They are quite light-weight, so you barely notice you’re even wearing them. Pairing these earphones is easy, simple and straightforward, and is accomplished very quickly, so you can get straight into listening right away. Sound Quality overall is very very good ! In fact, quite better than what I had initially expected. The audio experience is much like AirPod-style earphones, with the sound being directed straight into your ear-canal. Mid-Range and Treble sounds are very clear and very easy to hear. Bass sound response is fairly good, but has noticeable distortion at the very low frequency notes ( a problem not evident on the more superior BOSE Headphones ) [ Amendment : A new Firmware Update is now available and the update much improves the Bass response and the apparent distortion at high volumes is now almost completely Eliminated, enabling a far better audio experience overall ! ; Very Happy with this ! This brings the overall sound quality up much closer to that of the Apple AirPods and BOSE Headphones ! ]. ; The SHOKZ OpenFit supposedly has a Situational Awareness feature which supposedly allows you to stay aware of ambient sounds in your natural environment ( In fact this is the Primary reason I bought them in the first place ! ), but since I have only tested these earphones in my own room and inside a house, I haven’t yet had a chance to fully test whether the Situational Awareness feature works well or not. If I am using these inside my own room ( which is a quiet environment ) with the earphone volume up pretty high, I cannot really hear much ambient sounds outside of the earphones themselves. ; And like the Apple AirPods, the SHOKZ OpenFit Open-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Earphones are compact, and great for commuting, travelling, and vacationing with. ; Even though the overall sound quality isn’t quite up to the same standard as the BOSE headphones, which are definitely more superior, both the Apple AirPods and the SHOKZ OpenFits are both a lot more compact in size and more convenient to carry - an attribute a clear winner for both Apple and SHOKZ over the BOSE headphones, which are bulkier and more space required to carry. The overall sound quality of both the Apple AirPods and the SHOKZ OpenFits are still really good, and good enough for their compact size and convenience for travelling. Oh, and for those also using an Apple MacBook Air M2, such as myself, then YES, I can Affirmatively Confirm that the SHOKZ OpenFits DO work very well and easily with the Apple MacBook Air M2. ; If you are at home, in private, then the BOSE headphones are definitely the clear winner. If commuting and travelling is your thing, then the Apple AirPods would be the choice for Solo travelling. If you need to be able to hear normal ambient sounds from your natural environment, then the SHOKZ OpenFits is the most suitable way to go. ; For me, I’d leave my BOSE headphones at home, and I’d take both the Apple AirPods and the SHOKZ OpenFits Earphones with me when I Travel, and use whichever is the most appropriate at any given period. ; When you commute and/or go travelling, I would also recommend taking a pair of wired 3.5 mm compact earphones ( like the ones Apple used to include with their new iPhone releases ), as backup earphones, just in case your Bluetooth earphones run out of battery. ; I’ll be happy to say that for people who normally wear glasses or spectacles for their eyes ( like I do ), you can still wear them perfectly as normal and comfortably in conjunction with the SHOKZ OpenFit earphones, without either of them getting in the way of each other, and you can continue to comfortably listen to your music with the SHOKZ OpenFit earphones while keeping your glasses on perfectly in place. The SHOKZ OpenFit Earphones themselves, while they are outside of the charging case, they do Not have an Off switch or Off mode, so if they’re not in active use, you Must return them to inside the Charging Case and close the Charging Case in order for the earphones to attain something like an Off mode or Sleep mode, and retain their charge. ; Oh, and also, I gather you might like this about the Shokz OpenFit : Because a) They’re Open-Ear technology, and b) They have the Situational Awareness feature : If you have your music on either Pause/Stop mode or on Silent mode, you can still hold a perfectly normal verbal conversation with other people without having to remove the Shokz earphones from your ears ( and also still be able to perfectly hear other people talk to you ), and then return to your music and continue from where you left off without having to put the earphones back on again. ; [ Just for the record : I’ve even tried Bone-Conduction earphones, and from my own personal experience, I’d say “ Say goodbye “ to Bone-Conduction technology - they’re absolute rubbish compared to traditional headphones and earphones, including the Shokz Open-Fits, which are clearly a million times better than any bone-conduction trash ! Bone-Conduction technology doesn’t do anything for me ! ] ; For the sake of re-iteration, If we’re talking Shokz OpenFits, we’re really talking compact-ness and Portability ( On-the-go ). If you go out or commute and/or travel frequently, my best advice to you would be that in addition to the Shokz OpenFits, get yourself a good pair of Apple AirPods ( or equivalent ), and a pair of good 3.5 mm wired earphones, and take them all with you when you are out of or away from home. ; The SHOKZ OpenFit Earphones : Are they worth the cost ? : Well, AUD $ 289.oo I think initially is a pretty big ask, especially if you haven’t tried them on yet. How important is your music collection ( and your music listening ) to you ? You weigh up the worthiness, and determine for yourself whether my review and advice here would convince you to purchase them. I took a stab in the dark whether they would be as good as others have reviewed them to be, telling myself that I would not know the truth unless I bought them, and tried them out for myself. So far, I am quite impressed ! ; My final score for the SHOKZ OpenFit Earphones, out of 10 : 9.80 , or out of 100 : 98 ; Two thumbs up !",5,B0BYSQDWRT,2024,Australia
R2MKSUJCQ3EF0H,Horrible in phone conversations,"This is by far the worst earbuds for phone conversations if they are used in pairs. The sounds echo on both ends of the line, because the pair cannot sync properly. Shokz customer service's solution was to replace the unit after they receive the one I have. I will come back and write another review if the new unit does not have any issues, but regardless.... if you are paying $200 for a pair of headphones, you would expect them to be flawless? Am I wrong?
I will say though that the sound in listening to music is decent for this open ear concept.

REPLACEMENT UNIT:

Unfortunately, the replacement unit had the same exact problem, even after the recommended firmware updates and ""hard resets"". This brand is a total failure for me. Their customer happiness center and happiness makers could not make me happy with this purchase, therefore I am returning these. I am definitely not coming back to Shokz for ANYTHING EVER AGAIN.

RMXB61YM9WO79,"Decent Sound, Poor Controls and Power Charging","I bought these buds for the comfort shokz usually provides. But, I found that these buds are no up to par for the price paid. The touch controls are horrible. They have no volume controls, need extended time to pause or forward through video/music, and handles calls like worse then my other older shokz items.
The other thing is that they have no option to induction charge the ear buds in 2024 when this has been available on cheaper and more thought out brands for years. You're given a USB to USB type C cable and no plug to handle everything but seeing how the new standards are set to USB type C it feels like a slap to the customers that want to move past all the extra cables and plug to use the charging pads we have had for 10 years....shokz.
All in all the only thing these things can do is play sound from a phone. If you need to do anything else with them I suggest something else that has better use, thought, and engineering put into them. I will probably pass these off to a nephew or niece as a hand me down and will get something better for myself.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2024,the United States
R186UD3EPV892M,Second set still awful. Should be recalled,"Update:
Received a warranty replacement based on woeful battery life. The 'new' pair is just as bad. The only reason I still wear them is they were so expensive I feel like an idiot letting them sit. These should be recalled. When one sweats or if it's too dewy/moist outside, the volume goes either all the way up or all the way down. One is inconvenient, one is dangerous and uncomfortable. What a terrible poorly designed product.

I have had other SHOKZ products for years and as an avid runner/cyclist have enjoyed the ability to hear my surroundings. I was hesitant about this particular product but as an early adopter the company pitched a ""1 year satisfaction guarantee"". After a few months with these, they aren't good, at all. The battery life is awful on both the phones and the case. I've used them once or twice a week, the only reason it hasn't been twice as much is they are always dead. The headphones don't turn off when placed back in the case so they stay connected and apparently keep using battery. It's clearly a product that wasn't ready for market but got pushed that way.

I contact the company to ask how to return them and haven't heard anything back. I guess I'll follow up with a warranty claim next, even though I don't really want another pair of this awful product. The only reason I didn't return them sooner was a firmware update came out that I thought would help improve things. It didn't.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United States
R2HOUSW4RBA1V9,Disaster! Very low volume in calls and there is NO noise cancellation,"I bought these headphones, they are the second ones I have bought because of the brand and on the recommendation of a friend. I bought the AfterShokz Aeropex first (February 2023) and they are good but they do not have Noise Cancellation, but for music and calls in general they are fine. Now I buy the SHOKZ OpenFit and in addition to not having Noise Cancellation, the volume is very low. Added to this bad thing is that the Shokz APP is NOT available in my region! What madness is that? It is preferable to note when purchasing that your APP only applies to certain areas of the planet. In Latin America it only applies to three countries and we are 33 countries (650 million people). It is a lack of respect for the customer that, in addition to not working properly, you cannot use the APP to see if the Noise Cancellation volume can be corrected. It's a shame that I can't return it because I'm outside the USA and it's very complicated to make the return. I know now that I lost $180 and that I cannot recommend the brand because they are two Shokz headphones that I bought and they do not do what they offer. I forgot: the battery is not 28 hours...

New set will still only last from 10 am to about 5 pm before you start hearing the battery bleeps at 10%  Sound is still good, though. We will see how this set lasts.

Good customer service would have been all over this to try and at least apologize for the experience, but nope.

======================

Loved the sound quality, enjoyed the feature that I don't have to put it in my ear. I love it's intelligence. But then the charging unit started falling apart.

1. 28 hour listening time? LOL the most I could get out of them are about 8 hours. I'm a mail carrier and I can tell you exactly how long I have them on before they give out and there is no way that you can get 28 hours listening time.

2. First the spring in the hinge poked out. then it fell out. so then I wrapped a rubber band around it. then, it stopped charging after a couple months.

Doesn't matter how good it is, if it won't charge, it's not worth the purchase. That is too quick to fall apart considering the price.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United States
R29MR93ZMXHYQN,"Sound and microphone cut in and out, touch sensors are inconsistent","I was so excited to get these. The fit was great, I didn’t have problems with the charging but only had them for 5 days. In those 5 days, I’ve had my phone calls complain that my sound is cutting in and out while I’m speaking, and I’ve had my sound cut in and out while listening to the other folks on the other end—the sound also appeared to be inconsistent with the right and left buds.  One day the left was not working so I put it back in the case and reset them (I guess) and that made the problem go away at the moment. Then the listeners on the other end continued to claim that my sound was cutting in and out unable to hear me.

I also had a problem with the touch sensors…. I had to nearly punch the side of my head to answer a call. If I answered on my phone the buds would disconnect and I had to manually click back over to the shokz. Other days they were very sensitive and if I touched them the wrong way… or right way(?) I’d end a call accidentally.

IMO not worth the dollars they charge unfortunately.

The fit was great and I loved the packaging case, and charging concept.  The functionality, understanding when they were going to work and reliability is poor.  I’m returning them to find another product.",1,B0BYSQDWRT,2023,the United States

R24C5U5L3DL6C2,"Excellent product, but frustrating pre-order experience and missing promotional item","Overall: Excellent noise cancellation and sound quality, but frustrating pre-order experience and missing promotional item.

(4 star for this product and less than 0 for other delivery and support)

Pros:

Best-in-class noise cancellation: Effectively blocks out ambient sound, making them ideal for noisy environments.

Exceptional sound quality: Clear and balanced audio with powerful bass and crisp highs.

Comfortable fit: Ergonomically designed earbuds stay secure in your ears even during extended listening sessions.

Long battery life: Up to 36 hours of playback time with the charging case.

Cons:

Delays and communication gaps: I experienced numerous delays in receiving my order and encountered significant communication gaps throughout the process.

Pre-order issues: Many customers reported missing promotional items and delays in communication from Amazon.

Invalid coupon: After multiple buyers reported similar issues, Amazon provided a coupon code to claim the speaker. However, the code turned out to be invalid, adding to the frustration.

Limited communication avenues: Difficulty reaching anyone beyond customer service for assistance. The lack of transparent communication and escalation channels was deeply frustrating

Delivery : My attempts to resolve the missing speaker issue were met with delays, communication gaps, and unhelpful responses. I was repeatedly told the correct product was delivered, and no action was take

Recommendation:

While the WF-1000XM5 earbuds offer exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, the frustrating pre-order experience and missing promotional items detract from the overall purchase experience. While I appreciate the coupon code gesture, the invalid code further amplified the disappointment. If you can get past these issues, the earbuds themselves are excellent. However, if you value a smooth and reliable purchasing experience, you may want to consider other options.  This review is based on my personal experience and may not reflect the experience of others.

RI4AWYIF29Q3B,Multiple issues,"Sony WF 1000XM5
Even the name is pretentious, they are earbuds, not an experimental fighter jet.  I had Jabra earbuds and loved them.  The only reason I bought the Sonys is because I lost one of my Jabra earbuds while cycling and the Sonys had great reviews as their top of the line earbuds. I unboxed, charged them, then went through the pairing process.  Cumbersome right off the bat, you have to pair with the earbuds in their case with the lid open and press and hold a small button on the case.  The Jabras can pair with them in  your ears, and they TELL you when pairing was successful.  Every time you put them in your ears, the Jabras then tell you how many devices are connected, the Sonys don’t. The next problem with the Sonys was simply putting them in my ears without touching the touch sensitive pads. Because if you do, you change the setting on the earbuds. The Jabras have a pad that is a button the needs to be pushed.  By the time I’ve got them sitting properly in my ears, I’ve touched the pads so many times that I have no idea what settings I’ve changed. Then once they are in your ears, any time you happen to touch them, by accident or if you want to adjust the bud, you inadvertently change a setting. The touch sequences are ridiculously complicated. You have to touch 4 times in rapid succession just to change the volume and if you don’t touch 4 times fast enough, you’ve changed some other function. I use earbuds for two devices: my TV and my phone.  Both of which worked well with my Jabras.  After pairing the Sonys with both, I take them out of my case and there is no audible confirmation that they are connected.  If two devices are paired, the buds should only play the device that is on.  But the Sonys immediately wake up the phone and start playing the last music app that I had, even though it was closed and the TV was on and paired. If I want to hear the TV, I have to stop the music on the phone and try to connect to the TV. The most frustrating thing, and the “final straw” for me was that once connected and playing sound from the TV, they would randomly cut out after maybe a minute.  OK, so maybe I have some setting in the app wrong, so I go to the phone, open the app, and it says, “Sony Earbuds not connected”.  What?  They were just blaring music in my ears a second ago.  When I go the phones Bluetooth setting, they are connected according to my phone.  Go to Sony Troubleshooting (oh yes, the manual is only available on line, you can’t download it, so if you don’t have an internet connection, good luck reading the manual). Are your earbuds fully  charged?  Are you close enough to the Bluetooth device?  Are the devices correctly paired? Yes to all three, I’m not stupid. Finally, these two devices worked perfectly with the Jabras so it is not a problem with the phone or TV.
Perhaps there is some setting that is not right in the overly complicated app, but frankly I don’t have the time or inclination to mess with them any more.  I’m sending them back and buying Jabras again.",1,B0C33XXS56,2023,the United States

R1NGEHERK3IVHB,Very disappointing,"Very disappointed in the WF-1000XM5 ear buds.  I have the WF-1000XM3 ear buds and the XM3 has the best sound, best equalizer options, and best noise cancellation, of any earbuds I have tried (this includes Ultimate Ears, Bose QuietComfort, Soundcore Libert Pro2, et al). The problem is that the battery on the XM3 doesn't last longer than 45 minutes.  So when I saw Sony had released the XM5 I thought they would have the same great sound qualities and, hopefully, better battery life.
The XM5s do if fact have a MUCH better battery life.  But the sound features are abysmal. Especially compared to the XM3.  XM3 has THE BEST noise cancelling of any earbuds, and the switch between NC and ambient is seamless.
With the XM5 you have two choices for sound: ambient sound, or noise canceling. You can select Adaptive Sound Control and the earbuds will automatically adjust how ambient sound is filtered by learning how you use your earbuds as you move about your environment, and switches earbud settings at the optimal time.  Sounds good in theory, but Adaptive Sound Control in action sucks. I use my earbuds primarily while walking in urban environments, i.e. passing cars, conversations around me, leaf blowers, lawn mowers, etc. and the XM5 are the worst in class for outdoor environments.
First, while moving Adaptive Control tests the environment about every 10 seconds; when it does it interrupts the audio for about one second.  So about every 10 seconds the audio is blocked out while the AC ""optimizes"" your sound settings.  Second, there is absolutely NO noise cancellation while walking! In fact the opposite occurs:  the XM5s actually amplify the street noises around me, while simultaneously suppressing the audio sound track!  I went back into the app and reset the ambient sound control such that Ambient Sound was Off, and Noise Cancelling was the only option On. The audio track was not suppressed, but the street noises (especially passing cars and landscape equipment) continued to be amplified.
In a quiet, at home, environment XM5's audio quality is good but not superior to the XM3.  Mainly because of the lack of user friendly equalizer settings.  I'm sure this last statement will drive the Sony XM5 developers into a fit, but the new method of arriving at a desired equalizer setting does nothing more than force the listener into choices between preset equalizer defaults; it does not test the listener's ability/preference at discrete frequencies.  The end result is an equalizer setting with little to no benefit over ""NONE"".
So, for sitting around the house the XM5s are okay.  For anything else you get better, more reliable, audio at a much cheaper price.",1,B0C33XXS56,2023,the United States
RLOONUHTO3ZJR,Worse in every way than the previous model,"Every aspect of this model is worse than the XM4.

1) The sound quality is worse and the bass is severely reduced when compared to the previous model. For example: I had to crank the bass all the way up on BOTH the Sony headphones app and the Spotify app to achieve the same level of bass that the XM4 had by default. I've heard some people describe this as more ""audiophile"" quality but I'm just not getting that from what I've experienced.

2) The active noise cancelling might as well not even be a feature. It literally doesn't block out any noise from the outside environment and weirdly seems to change the EQ when cycling between ANC, Passive, and ""Off"" modes in an attempt to make you think it's actually doing some sort of noise cancelling.

3) The shape of the foam tips are now tapered in a way that make them extremely loose in your ears and may even fall out entirely even while doing low intensity movements like walking or chewing. Trying to get a solid seal even with the largest tips is impossible.

4) The shape and glossy finish of the earbuds themselves makes them frustrating to remove from your ears and the case and increases the likely hood of dropping them (and therefore possibly damaging them). Sony's decades of blatant planned obsolescence (or the ""Sony timer"" as some people might unfortunately be aware of) makes me believe that the tendency to easily drop these was intentionally designed, forcing people to spend more money on upgrades or repairs. The XM4 model has these issues as well, but at least that model actually sounded great while they were working.

R18SKO21FBK6TY,"Total crap comfort & user experience level, Opt for Bose QC Ultra or Airpods Pro 2nd gen","Everything is nice but I disliked two features as a normal which is very crucial for a user experience.

1. Company fitted Silicone foam doesn't give you a comfortable fit in the ear, it aches. When I changed it with small fit then ANC was compromised. For my ear medium & large size of bud foam is not compatible.
So do take into consideration before purchasing the item.

2. Volume control & mode control is very tedious & everytime you got to pickup your phone & change it.

If I compare it with ergonomics of Bose QC ultra earbuds then I find Bose QC Ultra to check all parameters of my requirements. I can wear Bose QC ultra for hours without problem but that can't be said for Sony WF- 1000XM5 as it very painful to wear them.

Sony need to work on ergonomics & user interface that's why I switched to Bose QC Ultra within a week after purchasing the Sony WF 1000XM5.",1,B0C33XXS56,2024,India

R1NKMGMZP56M9G,"Sound quality great, battery good, all else not so good","Sound quality is indeed great, seem good for calls, battery is good but i noticed some weird stuff happening, i will update on that later. Whats annoying is when you take the earbuds out of the box for longer without connecting them or the box is out of battery and  you can't turn them on even though they have battery, so i ha e to put them back in the box to wake them, and if the box is out of battery you have a problem even though they have battery. Thats stupid. The app also acts up with annoying notifications and the touch controls are not as configurable as they should. Some feature are annoyingly useless.
Now the worst. The fit is very bad. Although they are very light the fit is based on the ear canal so it's not trustworthy and one tends to stay in a position and the other in another. As mush as i try to push them in, with the right size foams, i can ear them slipping out. I can't feel them secure in place although they never actually came off by them selfs completely, nonetheless its annoying. Also and something that kinda seems on purpose for you to loose one of them and have to buh it again is that the earplugs are very slippery. I mean why would you make something so smal and valuable so polished in a way they can easily slip out of your hands when grabbing them... Seems so obvious that i doubt that wasn't on purpose.
For context i previously had the Sennheiser true wireles first edition, the sound quality was pretty much the same as these but the battery was bad and they had a defect that caused the battery to run out in 2 days or less, and they were very bad fo calls. But they had excellent fit and grip. Basically you just put it in your ear and twist it and it locks in place, the more you twisted it the more secure it got, was perfect aside from a litle disconfort that you got used to. I never ever had to ajust them on contraire of these sonys.
All in all not worth the money at least untill sony makes a solution for the fit. I only didn't return them because i didn't like the ones from bose and i wouldn't buy the new Sennheiser true witeless because i think they should have sent replacements for a product that was defective.

R2XBCHFMGWE7N,Not as Good as Previous Model,"Sadly, despite slightly better audio quality and a convenient mute button, the Shokz OpenComm2 is a downgrade in all other areas. Considering both product design and the revised software, the OpenComm2 is terribly flawed. I returned it after using it only one time.

First, for a headphone device explicitly marketed for communication use, it's rediculous that they have eliminated the double-button-press to redial the last number that was called. What!!!? ...And they've replaced it with more music control functionality. Why? That functionality is already available on their other products which were designed primarily for listening to music, not for making phone calls. If they wanted to add new functionality, then fine. But they actually removed an exisitng function that is central to phone communication.

Second, they have inexplicably moved the boom mic from the left to the right side, but moved one of the buttons from the right to the left side, thus splitting functionality up between the left and right hands. Now the main function button (for answering calls, hanging up calls, pausing music, and skipping tracks) is on the left side of your head while the volume buttons and the mute button are on the right side of your head. So, you no longer have all of the controls in one place and must use different hands at different times depending on what you want to do. The design of the previous model did not suffer from this gaping design defect. All of the controls were available on the right side of the head, arranged near each other, and the boom mic was on the left side of the head. The new design is ergonomically stupid and inefficient.

It is a shame. I really appreciate the better audio quality as well as the mute button on the boom mic. But the downgrades in both product design and software implementation are not sufficient to warrant a first-time purchase of (or an ""upgrade"" to) the Shokz OpenComm2 headphones.",2,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R2MR0W66A0OHLP,Volume and Mute buttons do not work on computer!,"I bought this headset so I could use it for MS Teams and Zoom calls on my computer.  I take several meetings each week on my computer and thought these could be a good change from the headsets that sit on my ears or the earbuds that go in the ears.  While the call quality is good on this headset while connected to computer, the fact that I can't control the volume or mute with the buttons on the headset make it a deal breaker on a headset that costs this much.

I did connect it to my phone and the buttons work on the phone, so it is not that the buttons don't work, they just do not work when using them with a computer.  This headset is marketed at use on PCs and phones, but they do not mention anywhere about the lack of controls on PC.

Also of note, while I didn't get these headsets to listen music, be aware that the sound quality of music through these headsets is really bad!  They sound like a cheap pair of generic $10 headphones.  Obviously these are made for voice, but for the price, you'd think the sound quality for music playback would be at least decent.  If you are considering getting these for music listening, go elsewhere.",2,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States

Because I do not like the effects that this technology has on our bodies. We have better technology. When it’s revealed, that will be a very good day. They don’t need to sabotage us.

They are comfortable and I like that I don't have to have things stuck in my ears however none of that means anything if they keep dropping calls.
Numerous times while i am in the middle of a conversation they just disconnect and stop working, whats worse is even though the call drops from headset, I can't hear the client on my computer at all so I have shut down to get the conversation back.

R1MQQP6T2E2GZU,Love love love… but came Flawed ,"I love Shokz my first were bought back in 2019 in Germany until my mom got a hold of them and then I got some for my wife recently, but I got a hold of them. Finally since I’m running a business I wanted a headset and saw these beauties marveling over them for 3 weeks. I watched every video and review I could find.  They came in the mail and I was ecstatic.

So first in the box
Warranty Card, guide, interesting bookmark (feels like steel, nice touch) headphone case(sturdy, smooth, sleek, black), and charging cable (proprietary)

Here’s what they feel like in the hand.✋
Small but with a presence, dense, silicone, strong quality plastic, bouncy, smooth and sleek.

Feeling on the head?
Weightless🪽🪶, very low pressure, fixed and stable, the mic hangs just on the crossing mark of my periphery mostly disappearing from notice, I can go all day with this things without a hitch because they feel like they were meant to be on my head. No ear pressure or rubbing or scratching, doesn’t leave itchiness, or sweat. Extremely comfortable.

Buttons☎️
Volume up and down, easily identified good click so you know your pressing it,
Multi function button, I really like for some reason, a little circle made of I think metal great click and press fun to press. I like it better than the open runs. It feels professional and sleek.

Sound
Crisp, Clear, Bright, fairly loud(from my experience in the past), voices are easily heard with great clarity and music has a great tone. If you have seen any reviews you know the bass is not very strong but I don’t see it terribly reducing the quality of music, for a refined individual as myself (sarcasm) bass is overrated. Sometimes when listening to podcasts with good sound it feels like they are in the room with you and the feather weight feel adds to that effect. The regular vibrations from the sound type are not at all annoying but I’m biased since I used my wife’s for 3 week straight so I’ve gotten used to it. My first shokz took me a bit to get used to. The weight and compression of the open comm though not noticeable on your head, is enough to keep them from pulling away from your head rapidly when vibrating🫨🫨 which would be uncomfortable if it did. (But there’s a flaw mentioned later)

Connection
Strong. Easy to pair. Multi device pairing that I have not yet tested.

Battery
Well I got them at 3 and wore them until 1145 so no problems there they boast a lot of hours and they it seems to hold. I mix between music podcasts and calls often. But

Calls
Voices came through loud and clear, at first my a friend said they I muffled but it might have just been the cellular connection cause we switched discord and both of our sound improved dramatically. But during this first call with my new shokz I found the issue. Something that would cause me much sadness.

Problem 
I had heard about this one issue appearing in some headphones where a transducer would get loose and cause a high pitch buzzing. Like a super high treble irritatingly blasting. Well, after my experience with the others I knew that there was something wrong with mine. The left ear had that buzz or fizz or rattle on full volume, I tested different songs, different podcasts, voices. At certain frequency ranges on full volume it shrieks in your ear just enough for it to be very unpleasant. The right ear does not have that problem. I switched between my wife’s to verify and they did not have this issue. I have sensitive ears and it’s just not something I want to have in my ear in loud situations and especially after the price tag I was hoping for perfection.
But I'm not upset.
I understand defects can happen at any level and I had heard very positive feedback about their quick responses and helpful customer service. so the day they arrived the same day I found out this issue I contacted them with my warranty card in hand, I’ve bought three pairs in total from them to this date so I hope they can honor their warranty.

I love them I really do, other than the transducer issue they are still a wonderful and helpful and quality product that I can get behind. I tell everyone about the shokz because they are innovative and awesome.

When I hear back about the warranty I will change my rating and hopefully can praise them for their customer support team.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R10OEDZNI6NMB8,You can charge while using & battery lasts just under 8 hours,"Firstly, I give unduplicatable and impeccable reviews, so I deserve some credit:

W/A

1. Mic is non-removable but can be turned out of the way without issue
2. Magnet for charger is very WEAK and when you attempt to charge while using beware: disconnecting the charger is a non-issue, however every time the charger reconnects, the OpenComms 2 will turn off! Turning on is fairly quick: hold one of the power buttons and it turns in and connects after some time.
3. The hardware's feedback is insanely obnoxious! Volume adjustment is always the same too-loud volume level. When turning the device on, you cannot use volume buttons to seek or play, and the device repeats your battery level regardless if you press volume up or down. And no, you cannot play, pause, or seek songs or podcasts (any media) from the power buttons. Volume buttons are strictly for: turning the device on, turning it off, and adjusting volume if you don't have the device in hand.
4. Sound quality is great and sounds really accurate. Bass will not reverberate but it does NOT sound as bad as those baseless tinny headphones from the 2000's. I would choose these over headphones any day. The bass is ""baseless"" but still sounds alright. No, audio is not balanced all the time in regard to fade or frequency, but it's a nonissue. Listening to someone speak over a podcast is clear and easily perceptive.
5. I will update this review after using with hearing protection and while driving a semi truck. I will attempt to use the mic to control Siri, so stay tuned.

Update:
The battery life is no lie, and it does charge to full quick. The whole ""battery high"" and ""battery medium"" is annoyingly broad, but if you're tracking your time usage it's not so tough to know when it's time to charge. I found myself using hearing protection more to hear better, and preferred the volume to be at almost the lowest level all the time. When I turned the volume up, any better connections would drown put anyone trying to talk to me and it was just too loud. The sound quality is no professional headset, but it's great for videos, podcasts, and okay for music.

The mic is completely useless for siri unless you're actively listening to audio through the headset, and even then I'm still unsure if it uses the microphone to trigger siri or if it's because the truck is just quiet enough.

I would definitely recommend these, even if you'll only use the microphone one to a few times a week.

The biggest caveat is the unbalanced audio. It often seemed as those I could hear audio out of the left ear than the right ear, as the right conductor was not touching to my skin enough. When I pushed it down, it felt like lots of travel, and I could not seem to bend it in place. They work great and it isn't a huge issue because they usually sound balanced. What are they worth? In my opinion no more than $110. Would I buy these OpenComm2's knowing all of this even though the price is way over $150? Yes. Button feedback noise? Uhg the beeping makes it worth maybe $40. The beeping is painfully loud and never okay. I have to separate these from touching my skin just to turn them on, off, etc.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R2EZ45SNZFMYZ7,Decent headset,"Sound is crisp and clear. Love the technology. My issue is with the claim to 16 hours of talk time. All headsets I have had in 10 years of driving trucks had tremendous amount of standby time on the battery. Shokz claims 16 hours of talk time. But 12 hours into a 14 hour shift with only about half of that actually talking, I get a low battery please charge message in my ear. 16 hours of talk time means I should get 16 hours of talk time. I only bought this one bc of the boasted 16 hours of talk time. I already had a cheaper headset with the same technology but it only got 8 hours of battery usage. I paid double what that cost and only get 2 to 4 hours extra usage. It would be worth the price if you actually get 16 hours of actual talk time. But that would mean decent standby time in order to achieve that. If you’re just after the technology, I advise getting the cheaper brand. Other than that the fit, mic quality, controls, etc are good.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R2WP9HVYDO7TT5,I've owned 3 of these,Two opencomm 2 uc and One opencomm 2. All have the same problem with the one button not clicking always so skipping a song sometimes only pauses. Or you'll click to play or pause and it doesn't register. Almost like the button gets caught on itself. My 6 pairs of open moves have never done this. As you can tell all Bluetooth headphones don't last long. Battery's die and they break apart easily. Or they stop charging in general. I do love the convenience of open ear listening. Only reason I'm still here. The UC adapter never worked for me and my setup so I only buy Bluetooth now.,3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
RSLOXO6EEVXJ6,"Very comfortable, however started to lose battery and button function after only a few uses.","Returned these after one week use due to malfunction. This is my second set of Shokz OpenComm. I have an earlier version purchased over a year ago which still work fantastic. I purchased these for convenience, and to have a second set as backup. They are slightly larger than their predisessor; However, I liked the material feel and improved sound quality. They paired flawlessly to my phone in seconds. Being the new toy, I decided to use them as my primary set. Thats when I realized the battery life dwindled and did not last into the afternoon, way less than the 16 hours talk time as advertised. Subsequently, the power on/off button became hesistant.

Ideally I would have liked an identical set like the old style. The new style microphone has been moved to the right side, from the left and I found it slightyly bothersome when drinking from a coffee mug. It was when I began experiencing the battery/function button issues within one week, I decided it was time to return them. I'm sure others will enjoy these based on comfort and I wish them success in their purchase. Hopefully mine were just a random flawed set and not a sign of a declining product or poor quality control. Time will tell.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,Canada
R1ZME0GUQ71WV5,Not sure yet.... underwhelmed for the hype,"Day 3 of ownership.  Reached out to Support for help... no response yet in 3 days.

This model is not compatible with their app, so you have no way to perform firmware updates or control sound or mic as with their other cheaper products.

Bluetooth range is huge, probably the best I've experienced.  It connects to the laptop well without the extra dongle needed for the UC model.

Music quality, not as rich or solid as a in ear experience, bone conductors have a tinny high frequency experience with little bass.. this was expected and not unique to Shokz.  I purchased these for the noise canceling boom. When hiking, walking and all other headsets seem to amplify all other sounds around me when I'm on calls.

So far mic noise canceling is 'ok' not great but definitely an improvement but calls hear me walking, scratching and even cracking my neck.  So far though ambient sounds from stores, washing up and TV/music has been blocked.

Charging cord is proprietary, in an age where even Apple backed down to USBC. Also it's kind of odd, magnetic and doesn't properly line up, takes a few tries to get it right.

I have a normal head, so I ordered the original size, it's huge in the back and snug on the temples.  The gap at the back is OK, atleast it doesn't rub against your skin as the rubber could be abrasive.

So far I'm leaning towards keeping them, more testing.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2023,the United States
R3SNXAF2LIM56U,Doesn't have 16 hour talk time.,I love everything about it except the battery life. I may ge 5 hrs talk time with it. I bought shoks because of the battery life. I was mislead by the advertisement.,3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States

Due to a discounted price, I re-purchased with the dongle. The difference is amazing. I’ll be writing a review for the combo pack in a few days.  Would be four or five stars if I only planned to use with a phone.",3,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R2E15MZD4M0SN3,Best bone conduction headset with boom mic,"If this headset meets your requirements for the job, I would definitely recommend it. I need to be able to answer the phone and hear/be heard clearly in noisy environments while also needing to speak with customers in person without having to take a headset on and off.

This headset is one of the few on the market that meets all of my needs.

Pros:
Battery lasts through long 12+ hour shifts
Overall premium look and feel
Boom mic ensures call clarity

Cons:
Fairly quiet, could use a bit more volume
Not the newest Bluetooth technology
I would prefer usb-c charging over proprietary magnetic charger.
Can start to hurt/rub back of your ear after extended use

Bottom line: it lets you have a private conversation or listen to music while still hearing your surroundings so if this appeals to you, it is one of the only options on the market.",4,B0C88R9FHG,2023,Canada
RKXCWZFCMVW72,Surprisingly good,"I recently tested several Bluetooth headsets, and without a doubt, this bone conduction model stands out as the best by far. Here's why:

Comfort and Design:
One of the standout features of this headset is its open-ear, bone conduction design. Unlike traditional in-ear models, it doesn't feel intrusive, making it incredibly comfortable for prolonged use. Whether I'm working at my desk or taking a walk, I almost forget I'm wearing it. Another practical advantage is that it doesn't interfere with enjoying a cup of coffee, tea, or any other drink, making it a perfect companion for multitasking.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality, while not premium, is good considering the bone conduction technology. It's a bit different from traditional headphones, providing clear and crisp audio while keeping my ears open to the environment. Whether I'm listening to music, taking calls, or watching videos, the clarity is consistently good, though it may lack some of the depth found in more conventional headphones.

Overall Experience:
In summary, this bone conduction Bluetooth headset excels in comfort, design, and sound quality. It's an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality headset that seamlessly integrates into daily activities without sacrificing audio performance. Highly recommended!",4,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R2KBFO7JLP9L5W,Doesn't work with two devices at the same time,"When you put in your item description that it has a multipoint bluetooth connectivity it is implied that item works with multiple devices at the same time.

Had to return the product.",4,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R36QGTTNAHTGAI,Multi purpose buttons don't work,I love my headset. Comfort and sound are amazing. The only complaint is that I cannot pick up calls unless I'm by my computer.

R78A7N8KST1KW,It is necessary to be in a quiet environment.,While the headphones cancel sound to the listener (the person on the receiving end) surrounding noise will affect your ability to hear a conversation or music etc.,4,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
R22JN97EIGRN7I,Trucker review,"Lightweight, decent sound but takes getting used to because the bone conduction vibrates face at higher volumes. If my head wasn’t so bit, this would be a great headset for me. I need another 1” added to the band for it to be comfortable for me. I wear a 7 5/8” hat.

Sound quality and battery life was great. Amazing noise cancellation and people I spoke to on other end said they couldn’t hear any road noise or cab noise from my extremely noisy semi truck

Recommend it you have a normal sized dome but if you have a large head, probably not a good choice",4,B0C88R9FHG,2024,the United States
RO6LBTXHG1RMC,Extremely solid telecom headset,"Battery life is incredible, and it's extremely light.  The audio quality isn't great if I'm honest, listening to music via this headset isn't great.  However, once put into voice enhanced mode it's VERY good at delivering clear representations of voices.  It's been helpful to me specifically in cutting through thick foreign accents while I'm on a video meeting, as well as amplifying distorted or poor microphones for others.  The mounting type conflicts with my glasses a bit, which results in some ear pain but this is consistent with other over the ear products I've used.  I do not fault the headset for this, I'm personally sensitive in this area.

All in all a very good headset if you're stuck in Teams / Zoom meetings all day.  But again, not great for music.",4,B0C88R9FHG,2023,the United States

RY8UBIJHUZDF6,Brilliant work headphones!,Love these headphones..!,5,B0C88R9FHG,2024,Australia
RUVMIB3J0J3DP,Works a lot better than a thought,"I have been tempted by the idea of bone induction headphones for a long time, but worried that the quality of audio wouldn't be great!.
I was totally blown away by the quality, and frequency range when I took the plunge and bought them.
Very quick and simple to pair with my mobile phone. Both call quality and playing music the audio frequency is brilliant, the bass is slightly reduced, but that is only to be expected as normally headphone have reduced bass range, and real deep bass is more air vibration felt by the skin than heard. But it is very good.
Every time you power up, it gives you high/medium/low verbal confirmation of battery power, plus your Bluetooth connection gives 1-100% reading, to tell you when it needs recharging.
My only criticism is if you have thicker, long hair, the back bar that runs around the rear of your head, might slightly misalign how you wear them.
I now wear them most of the day at home, for taking and making calls, simple because I can wander away to the kitchen and still pick up calls without rushing back to get to my phone. Bluetooth range is very good indoors. It took a few days to get use to wearing them long time periods, but in less than a week I put them on soon after waking up till almost bedtime now.
I can get around 2 days before considering charging currently.
In call quality is excellent, and no-one I've been talking to has commented about poor reception from my call, so can assume they are not aware I'm on Bluetooth connection.
Wide volume range controlled from the headset. I would suggest making sure your Bluetooth volume setting on you phone is at MAX, then control your personal choice from the headset volume controls.
It took a couple of days to get use to the very slight pressure that pads have on your face.
I would say to anyone looking for freedom and two free and ability to move about while on a phone call GO FOR IT.

I’m chatting with clients, attending a Zoom meeting, or waiting for a call. The SHOKZ OpenComm2 is very comfortable to wear and does not fatigue your ears like all-day headphones or earbud wearing causes. I also wonder if having your ear canals open to the air is safer.

I work alone, so being able to monitor my surroundings is important. I like to know what my corgi is getting into when my back is turned. Bone conduction is like having an extra set of ears. I can focus on a call, but monitor my environment.

The SHOKZ OpenComm2 will easily last a day. Shokz says there are 16 hours of runtime, but fortunately, I’ve never had that long a day in the office. :-)

The boom mike offers superb noise reduction. I live in a windy area and have used this outside (I admit to sneaking outside to play fetch with my dog on some long calls.) with no problems being understood by clients.

The controls are easy to use; I prefer tactile buttons to touch screens.

The sound quality is great for hearing callers, and you can listen to music on the SHOKZ OpenComm2, but the sound quality is not as good as on the Shokz Open Run, which I own. That’s not an issue for me, as I work alone and usually have my hi-fi blaring. But, if you are concerned with music, realize that the SHOKZ OpenComm2 is designed for voice reproduction, not music. Bassheads look elsewhere. :-)

The SHOKZ OpenComm2 offers dual pairing and seamless links between two devices. I use it with my phone or through the Shokz Loop (See my review on Amazon.) when using my computer.

The only thing I would change on the SHOKZ OpenComm2 is the charging port. This uses the standard proprietary charger used on all Shokz units. It works well with a secure magnetic connection, but I would prefer the industry standard USB-C connection. The proprietary cable is well made, but it is one more cable to lug around and track when you travel.

The carry case is hard-backed and very protective. There’s room inside for a cable and a Loop.

In conclusion, the SHOKZ OpenComm2 is a well-designed bone-conducting headset that offers a solid connection, all-day comfort, and fantastic noise reduction. It is an excellent investment if you talk with clients all day.",5,B0C88R9FHG,2024,Canada

The app is necessary for initial set up, but unless you want to trigger a setting change, it just needs to be on your device.

R10YNQWVGRRCKP,great audio but uncomfortable if you're bald or have short hair,"The sound and battery life are great. I love being connected to my laptop and phone at the same time, but sometimes it can act glitchy, such as when playing Spotify on my phone, I have to remember to go into the Headphones app and tell it to prioritize my phone over my laptop. There are other glitches I've had trouble figuring out, such as how to disable voice-activated conversation mode after it's turned itself on.

The main issue I have is with comfort: The headband is basically a rounded plastic bar instead of a wide flat surface. It's padded, but if you're bald like me, the entire weight of the headphones is resting on a pencil-wide stripe across my scalp, which gets uncomfortable long before my workday is over.

But the noise cancelling is SPOOKY good. I wouldn't hesitate to wear these on a 3–4 hour flight—with a baseball cap so they don't leave a dent across the top of my head.",4,B0CFSD4TSQ,2024,the United States

R3DFSIUWDIXEN7,Horrible Battery Life,"The sound quality is good, the fit is ok, the battery life is horrible. I bought the SHOKZ OpenFit Air hoping they would be better than the original OpenFit but they are not. The first time I wore them I charged the battery all night to make sure they were fully charged for my long run the following morning. And even with a full charged battery the battery still completely drained after 1hr. of listening to music. I decided to give them one more try incase that experience was a fluke but nope.. Today they barely made it through a 3 mile recovery run that took me 48 minutes to complete. By the end of my run one of the era buds was completely dead and the other one had 1% left. Needless to say, I returned them. I had a similar experience with original Shokz Open Fit. The battery on those lasted a little longer than the Air but no where near as long as they were advertised to last, so I had to return them as well. Super disappointed because I really wanted to love these as they have such good reviews. Not sure if ordering directly from Shokz would be better. I’d like to give the Open Run Pro a try but honestly after having 2 bad experiences with the OpenFit line that might not be the best idea. ",1,B0CRTMHVTG,2024,the United States

R1C029FE4MLGAB,"Comfortable to wear, but the sound quality is just ok","TLDR: A little more comfortable than the older OpenFit model (not Air), but the sound quality is noticeably worse.

I just got these earbuds this morning. The earpiece is a bit bigger than on the previous model, I guess to fit the battery. Despite that fact they are still a bit more comfortable to wear than the older model, as the part that goes behind the ear is much thinner and flatter. You may still feel some discomfort if you are wearing them for a few hours.

The audio quality, however, is significantly worse than on the previous model. It's flatter, quieter, and the basses are not as potent. It was noticeable on some songs more than on others, but the difference is definitely there. It's not terrible though, and if I didn't have the older model to compare with I would probably keep this one. This item costs about $50 less, and I think they had to cut some corners to lower the price.

If you already own the older model then don't waste money on this one. Otherwise it may be a good option, especially for phone/zoom calls. Not so much for music though.",3,B0CRTM6B55,2024,the United States

The sound isn’t quite up to the Bose quality but still very good. But the Shokz blow the Bose out of the water on phone calls. People seemed to have trouble hearing me on calls with the Bose which made me keep a pair of AirPods with me when making calls. I haven’t had any complaints on calls with the Shokz. And I’ve made several calls in the 3 days I’ve had them. They are a comfortable, light weight fit over the ears. I thought there might be a problem when wearing my reading glasses but not at all.

R1RXEJHPHZ2T91,"Great, but one flaw","I have had a pair of Shokz running headphones for years, absolutely love them.  I've always wanted the swimming ones too but was always put off by the lack of bluetooth connectivity so couldn't wait for the OpenSwim Pro to be released as they have both bluetooth and MP3.

The sound quality out of the water is of a good standard, they work well for calls too, they're really comfortable to the point you forget you're wearing them and what I love most is being aware of what else is going on around you.

Overall, i'm very pleased with how they work in the water too.  From a comfort perspective I kept thinking they were going to come off but they don't, even if you swim fast.  I did find however that sometimes when pushing off the wall fast they feel like they will come off but they don't.  The sound quality is good considering there is a lot of splashing water noise with swimming and you can improve the quality more with the use of the earplugs they provide, but I don't think you need to use them.  When swimming fully underwater the sound is amazing because you don't have the splashing background.

I always wondered how well the bluetooth connection would work with these when swimming.  It works, so you can stream music while you're swimming on the surface, but as soon as you fully submerge your head you loose the sound for the time you're under the water.

So why a 4 and not a 5?  Simply because of the MP3 functionality.  With the 32GB storage you can store thousands of songs - which is great.  The problem is there is no way of navigating the songs or podcasts to choose the media you want to listen to (not via the device or the app on your phone).  So the headphones either play through the songs sequentially, in shuffle or on repeat.  If I put them in folders, it makes no difference, there is no way to just select a folder of songs to play.  This to me is a fundamental design flaw.  I wanted to listen to a podcast and only had two choices to find it to play - I either had to skip through all the songs manually to find it, or I had to delete everything else on the headphones to find it easily.  I chose the latter.  It's a pity, Shokz couldn't nail this navigation issue as I can see it will make it rather frustrating over time.

Would I recommend these?  In short, Yes.  If you like to swim and want some entertainment, buy these - I don't regret it and i'll just hope that Shokz can solve the MP3 navigation flaw with a software update!",4,B0CS3JBP67,2024,the United Kingdom

R2X5G5JC6GQSOK,"Comfortable, secure fit with clear sound","Open ear wireless headphones are becoming more and more popular recently with a wide selection of manufacturers.  Shokz has always been a leader in open ear headphones for exercise, and the OpenFit Air are the latest addition to their product line-up.

Fit: Each earphone is extremely light, weighing only 8.7g each.  The body size is also longer than the OpenFit, which leads to a more secure fit in each ear.  The body is also angled in slightly, bringing the speaker closer to your ear for better sound with less audio leakage.  The material is also very comfortable on the skin.

Sound: The sound is clear with good bass, even at high volumes.  I've heard reports of the original OpenFit distorting when the bass is loud, but I can't replicate that with these, so they're an improvement in that regard.  There is an EQ in the app to choose from vocal, bass, or treble boost, but the default setting sounds great, so no need to change.

App:  The app enables some additional features like multipoint connections and customizing the touch controls.  The headphones can be connected to two devices at the same time, but the app keeps a record of which devices you've paired to and you can switch which two are active at any time.

Case:  The case is small and feels very solid.  The hinge is sturdy and the lid snaps shut due to a spring, but is held closed with magnets.  There was also a soft pouch that fits the case to protect it from scratches in your pocket.  You can also use the pouch to wipe down your headphones before putting them away which helps to keep them and the case clean.

Overall: Highly recommend!  I hope that you get more options for maybe a custom eq or touch control options, but as is, they work very well.",5,B0CT7C1CP1,2024,Japan

R35MZFKM5GQXLK,Didn't last 5 weeks,"I have cheaper ear buds that worked way better than these did (AND both of those sets still work!).
My son gave these to me for fathers day. I typically only use one ear bud at a time unless cutting the grass. Unfortunately these did not work independently from one another, only the right ear bud- or both (now neither). In the beginning, they charged faster than my others and lasted A LOT longer. They never got loud enough for me to hear my audio books over my the lawn mower (even though my cheaper ones do).  Playing music sounded great.  I only used them a few times a week, but last week I noticed the charge didn't last long enough to mow. I put them back on the charger and as soon as they were full charge, or so I thought, it only lasted 30 or so minutes. Again I charged it (way longer than normal) and that night it only lasted about 20 minutes.

The reason I thought it was charging is because it was only acknowledging the left ear bud. When I remove the left ear bud from the station it doesn't see the right one at all now. It's been on charge all day and it didn't last 5 minutes tonight.  I will contact the seller and return to leave feedback.

The case itself is superb. It might be the best thing about them.

My only issue with these is that they do not quite go far enough into my ear.  I've tried the different ear cushions to see if i can get a better fit but i can't.  If I were to jog or run with these, there is no doubt i would lose them. However they are not sport earbuds so that is to be expected.

The fit issue isn't enough for me to want to return them.  I just wanted something wireless that i could leave at work and these are just fine.

UPDATE: Not even a year in and the right earbud has stopped working.  Unfortunately that is the important one so the left one is useless by itself.

...But the left one refused to connect. Sound out of only one ear. (Also, first time I tried it, the sound was horribly scratchy and cutting in and out, with a lot of static. When I tried again later, it sounded fine, at least out of the right one.)

I've already set up a return on these. Wish I had checked the reviews more carefully.",1,B07HS1V2QK,2021,the United States
R1XIBDUD88O2QV,Sooooo bad,Only the right earphone is Bluetooth so if that dies you can’t use the left and also my right earphone just broke randomly I was using it earlier put it on charge and now is broken. so now they are useless,1,B07HS1V2QK,2022,Canada

Sound is ok at best. Thought these were a great find, they re not! UPDATE: These were regular price 200$ on sale for 89$ on prime days. Now they are REGULAR price 89$. Overpriced to put a special on them. Returned them and still no refund. Fraudulent publicity!!",1,B07HS1V2QK,2020,Canada
R26RWOVB88B1R6,Stopped working out of the blue. Waste of money.,Right earbud suddenly stopped working after less than 1 year. Works only when it feels like no matter how it is charged. Right ear bud is the only one that connects to Bluetooth so really can't even use one side anymore. So frustrating.,1,B07HS1V2QK,2021,Canada
R144OO1AVOCOXF,DOES NOT LAST :(,"First bought in September, which stopped working 1 week later. I returned it can got a replacement fairly quickly though Amazon so that was great!

Earlier, I had problems with the same side where it had difficulty pairing with the right side and operating correctly.  Would have to restore both sides back to the charging case in order to have the pair work.  I've purchased JBL products in the past and have had very good results with the brand.  These earbuds seem not to be the norm.  I read some of the prior reviews and see that others have had the same experiences with the left side earbud.  I hope that JBL hears the kind of feedback they are getting from this product.  I will not purchase this product again.

We talk on the phone alot m, he couldn't hear me or understand what I was saying,  thats why we bought them. To hear me better and understand what I was saying to him.
Funny thing  when I called AMAZON  about them, it was like they was waiting for me to call them about the DEFECTIVE JBL EARBUDS.

RMIJJIP1J1POP,Left earbud is defective,You might find similar reviews regarding this product. The left earbud is defective and it does not get activated nor it pairs. Company should test their product before putting them on the market. A very bad customer experience.,1,B07HS1V2QK,2020,Canada

RZ4V83Y2AJDJ1,Not good for meetings,"I bought these because of a co-workers recommendation. If you're listening to music they're great. If you're using them for a meeting, they suck big time. I only had hearing in one bud so I checked the settings. When I switched to stereo the sound cut in and out. Very disappointed in this purchase.

UPDATE: after having these for a few months I have to say they are the worst earbuds I've ever owned. I can't use them with my laptop at all so I decided to use them with my phone.  Usually only one bud will connect and I have take them out and dock them and keep trying until both connect. They don't fit well so they're always falling out.

R2B1E15294BA3A,Very tight for larger heads,"I have a larger head for a woman, probably about the size of average dudes. The headphones feel very tight and give me a headache after about 10 minutes of wearing them. I'm constantly adjusting them to move the pressure on to a different part of my ear. My ears are not that large but the headphone ear pieces are on the small side so they have to sit on the ear in some way.

The sound quality is okay for budget headphones. Build quality is decent, better than generic brands from China.

I do like how light and portable they are for this type of headphone. They fold up easily and don't take up much space when you throw them down on your desk. This makes them easy to use and access and that's the main reason that has earned it 3 stars. The white colour is pretty enough.

Overall I'm satisfied but may be giving these to my 7 year old daughter if I can't manage to find a way to avoid getting headaches wearing these.",3,B08WM298TV,2024,the United States
RBHA3Y0D7RF5S,Keeps disconnecting from phone,"For some reason it doesn't keep its connection with my phone. I think it's because I also have it paired with my fire stick and it takes priority for some reason. Even when I fully unpair it and pair it again or restart my phone it doesn't connect again for a very very long time, like hours later. I even unpaired it with my fire stick and it still doesn't connect. It must be some kind of glitch or something. Otherwise the sound it good but having it constantly disconnecting makes it pretty useless. I have a Pixel 7 Pro. I also looked into downloading the app to see if it needed to update but this specific model headphones aren't on there. So I'm at a loss. I've had these for about 7 months and slowly I have gathered this information and came to these conclusions over that time.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States
R3UE26311SAC1K,Highly Mediocre experience.,"I am perplexed by all these great reviews.  They are not very comfortable to wear.  I don't have a huge head or anything.  To be extra clear, I am talking about the part that goes over the top of the head.  Even with the adjustments set to the maximum length it still feels weird on the top of the head.  I dont know why.  I feel like the headphones my sony discman came with 30 years ago are more comfortable than these by far.

Sound quality is good.  I will give them that.

I am very glad I got them on ""sale"", as I see they are back to their full price of $50 now.  I would return them at that price.  However for $30 I will keep them.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States
RJTKGSNL43R58,These hurt!,"I guess I'm just used to over-ear headphone that cover the entire ear, or earbuds. I kinda don't get bothering to make a circular ear cover that doesn't envelope the entire ear. These smaller ones just press against the ears a bit hard, and hurt enough to have to take off after a while. I'm about a week into owning these, and I can wear them for longer periods. It reminds me of developing callous on the fingers when learning guitar. My next purchase will be full-sized. Too bad blue-tooth doesn't work for live musical Instruments. Oh yeah, there is a slight delay when I connect to my PC that is more noticeable once one becomes aware of it. (Sorry if you own this already!)",3,B08WM298TV,2024,the United States
R21PUXO47SA7A7,Impressed for about an hour.,"These headphones seemed to be the answer to my prayers for maybe 60 minutes. I loved listening to Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me until my laughter started annoying my husband, who then tried to talk to me, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid with my headphones. Then I suddenly felt warm and I thought I was having a hot flash, after a moment of dread I noticed it was my ears. My ears were burning up.  I took off my headphones only to discover SWEATY EARS! I hate being hot. And I hate being sweaty.
I thought I would try again tonight to see if the same things occurred. Sure enough, my laughter got side eye looks, and when I shouted out the answers to my game show my husband cried “what are you shouting at”, and soon he was bemoaning that he couldn’t talk to me.  My response was, “hmmm. It’s like trying to talk to you when you’re watching golf, football, basketball, or baseball.”  My ears still got hot and sweaty and at this point the sound isn’t balanced. The right ear isn’t nearly as loud as the left ear 
So I came on Amazon to see what exactly my dear husband paid for these ear sauna, husband whining, lopsided sounding headphones. $34. Well that explains a lot.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States
RSGELOY03JSQZ,Blulky Heavy On The Head,"I bought these on sale for $29.95 USD. The headphones are visually attractive, but I feel like a dork because they are bulky and look funny on my head. I still wear them in public, but soon these shall be retired for home use only. The headphones are also heavy on the head after one hour or more.... the user may need to  readjust to keep them in a non taxing position. I wouldn't buy them again, but I dont hate them. They are just annoying and bulky and I am sure the $150.00 USD version is badass. I wouldn't buy again because of the fit, I do i have a large size head.",3,B08WM298TV,2024,the United States
RFA29T8JB6OWJ,These are NOT noise cancelling,"When searching for noise cancelling headphones to wear on flights, these popped up. JBL is a name known for their quality products so I ordered them without hesitation.
When they arrived, I tested them by wearing them while I ran the vacuum. No good; I had to turn the volume up so high to cover the vacuum noise that my ears hurt. I read the manual more closely and discovered they are not advertized to be noise cancelling. Silly me; I just assumed when they came up in the Amazon search that they were. Other than tha, these headphones were comfortable and the sound quality was good.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States

Now I'm hearing metal and hip-hop at the same time.

Pros: Comfort is great they're totally adjustable and they have a great sound quality.

I have a medium sized head and have trouble keeping these on while active in the gym. They fit well for a couple weeks but slowly stretched out and do not fit snuggly any longer. Of course, I'm 2 days outside of my return window, or these would be returned!

R1RQ5RRSI8OKHE,Pros and cons from an AuDHD (autistic and ADHD) buyer,"PROS:
• Comfy on the head and ears (longest worn for about an hour and a half at the gym).
• 8/10 sound quality. Fairly basey and thumpy, doesn't sound like I'm underwater.
• Sound is immersive, great for ASMR and general focus in a quiet area.
• Doesn't fly off the head while in motion.
• Connects to bluetooth very quickly.

CONS:
• I don't know what gyms y'all are going to, but mine plays music the whole time on their speakers. These headphones DID NOT cancel out the outside noise at all. In comparison to my Skullcandy earbuds which I still have and use, these are in no way of use in a noisy environment. Started getting overwhelmed too quickly due to way too many noises around me. Gonna stick to the earbuds when it comes to the gym for now on.
• I originally bought these because wearing earbuds for too long hurts my ears. I do like these, but I'm gonna keep to only using them at home or maybe walking in the park to give my ear canals a break from my buds. These do not work for louder spaces.
• Unfortunately, I have neighbors that are sort of a block a way that play annoying music sometimes, and I can still hear them with these on. They're nearly a block away. I'm in my house.
• So essentially the biggest con is that these are, like... 10-15% noise cancelling. Should've been a little cheaper than the sale price, and definitely shouldn't be almost 50 bucks at full price.

TL;DR:
Comfortable, clear sound, secure, but absolutely not fully noise cancelling as claimed on the product. Overall 7/10, would more than likely get a different headphone set from a different brand if these were to fail on me someday.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2023,the United States

R1D2M2PH3PVJMO,Not intended for critical listening,"I'm glad I bought these during the Black Friday sale of 2023 for $25, because I would not pay a dime more for them. The sound quality is OK for the price, but nothing spectacular. They are ""on-the-ear"" design, not over-the-ear, so there is no noise-cancelling, but I'm OK with that. I have earbuds when I want to shut out the world around me. There are no crisp highs—hardly any highs at all, actually. Stewart Copeland's brilliant high hat work in Peter Gabriel's ""Red Rain"" is inaudible. Jeff Pocoraro's ""Rosanna"" shuffle seems flat.

On the positive side, stereo separation and imaging are decent. The headphones are fairly comfortable. I have a large head, and at first they were a little snug, but loosened up after a few hours. Can' t comment on battery life, but it has been a few days since I needed to charge them.

RMN56NK7DD62Q,Bad if you have TMJ.,"I wear headphones literally every waking hours, and am very particular about my requirements. Largely, they need to be comfortable to be worn that long, have a usable battery, and I’m specifically looking for a pair right now that actually works with my 2012 iMac. Surprisingly, a lot don’t and the Bluetooth seems to stutter/fail on the computer, or the headphones playback slightly detached from what I’m watching.

These JBL TUNE 510’s connected fine, and the audio quality was okay. It felt very… dampened? Like everything had been squashed together into a homogenized sound instead of letting there be peaks and valleys where you want there to be. All sounds were at one standardized volume, is what I’m trying to say. This doesn’t matter TOO much for me, since I’m no audiophile and am frequently attempting to AVOID sounds, but it’s worth noting for those who care.

I have TMJ, where my jaw frequently dislocated, so I need to be careful about pressure around my mandibles. Not only is it just generally uncomfortable, it can become actively painful and leave me unable to talk or eat properly.

Anyway, these headphones squeeze too tightly around the mandible/space in front of the ear area, and I couldn’t last longer than about ten minutes with them. Unfortunate, because it seems like they’d be a decent option otherwise.

Also, as far as dampening outside sounds, I can’t use active noise cancelling because I find it irritating/painful. I look for headphones that provide a good barrier between myself and the world—enough so that it’s not entirely painful, but that I can still mostly understand people speaking to me without needing to remove them, if nothing’s playing. These dampen a bit too much for practical use as ear defenders, unless you’re looking to really, REALLY turn down noise. Just the physical barrier the earpieces allow cut my baseline sound down from 200%, down to maybe 60%. Meaning I know that my baseline hearing is more sensitive than most, but with these headphones on, my auditory processing disorder made it even more impossible to understand conversation because TOO much auditory detail was lost.

Anyway, I’m returning them. I wouldn’t recommend for use if you have TMJ, or particular pressure sensitivities on the sides of your head/face. And if you want high-quality audio where you can really live inside the sound, this ain’t it, either.",3,B08WM3LMJF,2022,the United States

Might be made more for a kid or skinny head but not for me. The pressure on my ears makes my ears feel tired. I have mixed feelings about them.

I immediately went back to my Zihnic pair, and those sound better, albeit slightly muffled in comparison. And where's this bass they talk about? Non-existent.
I was not happy with the fit initially since I prefer the ear cups to cover my whole ear, but I have a tendency to pull one muff behind my ear while people need to talk to me, and for that these are much more comfortable than the rigid style. They are also more lightweight and I wore them down around my neck for awhile and barely noticed them.

RW5V9ZRLIBOL8,Decent by have some issues,"Update: I still think these are decent headphones that do the job. The battery life is amazing, but I'm also using them less than I used to. The number one issue: they shut down frequently at random intervals throughout the day. As often as once or twice an hour they will just shut down even while full charged and while I'm actively using them (so its not like they are going to sleep). I know this is a relatively small thing, but its still super irritating when I'm in the middle of dictating a sentence of text and they just shut down. This is a known issue - google it and you'll see dozens of reports - and I've tried the fixes recommended and none of them have worked. If the damn headphones would stay on and not quit every 20 mins I would use them and like them more.

Previous review:

I've been searching for good bluetooth headphones to use for dictation on my computer for years. This is probably the 3rd pair I've purchased and so far they are ok. As many reviewers noted, they are not very comfortable after you've been wearing them for a while. I can use them for about 90 minutes and then have to take them off as they are squeezing my ears/head. The pain sometimes lasts for a while too - not very pleasant. The sound quality on my end is pretty good and anyone I'm talking to reports clear sound transmission (through my computer, haven't used them on my cell yet). On dictation specifically: they seem to be pretty good in terms of picking up what I'm saying and converting it to text. Sometimes they struggle to pick up the nuances between similar sounding words, but that could also be the shitty Mac dictation app - it's not always possible to tell.

The only other thing to note is when I'm wearing them between calls or not listening to audio, there is a weird clicking in the right ear. I've adjusted them, taken them off, shaken them, etc. and the damn clicking sound keeps happening. It's not that bad, but can be distracting when I just need quiet time.

RYL8VVZJON2HA,Excellent value for money,"Headphones arrived days early in time for Memorial Day. This is a standout offering from JBL; instruction sheet very clear with helpful illustrations- very easy to set up with my Linux computer as well as iPhone. For Bluetooth the sound quality from these on ear cams is very good including decent, though sometimes a bit boomy, bass. Comfy - I wore them for 10 hrs straight with PC use. I don’t know how JBL engineered such good battery life and the charging time with the USC c connector is fast. And the BT range is phenomenal; I put my iPhone on a charging stand and went outside, down the sidewalk, over 50 ‘ before sound breakup - the when I got back in range the connection recovered.

R2OL3WGKWTXMD6,Great sound isolation!,"I think that is the correct term. What I mean is that ambient noise is reduced about 70%. I've used these headphones to call my sister and had to move one headphone off an ear because I found myself raising my voice to hear myself, which must have made my sister think I was yelling at her. There is no voice feedback feature for the wearer to switch on for calls, with predictable consequences.

For the price:

Sound quality is excellent. The lower frequencies hip hop lovers enjoy is present. You can ""feel"" your music. Heavy metal guys like me are equally satisfied by the balanced frequencies.

Comfort. Well.... 50 years of headphone use has shown me that you get what you pay for. The most expensive pair I've worn were the best in terms of comfort, but weighed almost as much as a motorcycle helmet--a good 3.5 to 4 pounds. But they were comfortable. These headphones are good for the price, adequate for my needs. I could probably wear these headphones for 2 hours, but I'd know they were there, if you know what I mean.

Physical buttons. Wonderful! Kind of. I haven't yet figured out how to use the buttons on the headphones to answer and end a call--although other users have been successful. But I love being able to adjust the headphone volume without needing to access--in this case, my pc's volume control app.

Do I recommend this product? Only with some caveats. I wouldn't run, lift weights, or cycle with these on. I would wear them while straightening up around the house, working on my car, maybe listening to background music while reading or studying. They are also handy for listening to those YouTube videos with poor sound quality. For all other uses, I prefer my JBL Endurance Peak 3 in ear buds to the JBL Tune headphones.",5,B08WM1V5P1,2024,the United States

R3KWPG8GR2HDPG,"Get these! Super sturdy, long battery life, and great sound quality!","I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.
I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.

PROS:
1. Personally, I don't like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn't have to be turned up that much, either.
2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the ""earmuff"" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I've brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.
3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.
4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.
CONS:
1. Mishapen. I'm not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.
2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.

TLDR;; Buy these! I'm sad to see them go but I'm definitely getting another pair once the price drops.
I got a pair for my mom and she LOVES them too!",5,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States

R3GV7XQ42Q0PU7,AMAZING VALUE.,"Not sure if there's a point in writing this as it seems you can't buy them anymore,  but the sound quality is amazing for the price. I had another similar pair a few years back that was triple the price (also JBL) and I swear it didn't even work as good as these. The sound is so intense and doesn't completely drown out outside noise but does a pretty good job that while watching a show there was a loud noise that literally scared the f*** out of me because I thought it was right behind me lol. The battery if treated properly will last three 12 hour days at least from full charge. Also good for working out, they stay on great but do tend to get sweaty on the inside as is normal with headphones. Plus the pink is so cute. My only complaint is within like 4 months the one connection point between the top band and the actual ear thing just snapped and now I've had to order another pair which luckily happened days before they stopped selling them. Since it's jbl you'd think there would be a limited warranty or something but apparently nothing at all. Still not good though my other pair lasted me upwards of 5 years and was still good till my dog destroyed them so for this to just snap so soon for no good reason was really frustrating. I wasn't rough with them or anything so idk if it was just a dud or if that's the quality of them all. Still ordered another though because the quality for this price is like unheard of. Hopefully they didn't stop selling them for good!!",5,B092CP8ZH4,2023,Canada
R146F9SOUBVPFI,Affordable headphones with great quality,"The headphones offer excellent sound quality, user-friendly operation, and some noise isolation. They come with a separate charging port for added convenience. However, one drawback is that the charging indicator light remains red throughout the entire charging process, making it challenging to visually determine when the headphones are fully charged. As a solution, I have to connect the headphones to Bluetooth on my phone to check the battery percentage. This could potentially be an issue specific to my headphones. Nevertheless, the headphones do charge fully.",5,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States

R39AX1F4BBRVIR,Hearing the Invisible,"I bought a set of JBL ear buds so I could work in the shop and listen to some opera as well as classic rock  with impunity.  “Keeping it to myself” took on a whole new meaning and I tried to work with that dictate, so bought the buds.  But they kept falling out, the music was lackluster with little or no bass component, and I just felt they didn’t give me the listening experience I was looking for. It’s hard to tell until you try them.  I recognize that listening tastes are personal, so I returned the buds in acknowledgement of their apparent shortcomings. Despite not being a power user I have had other, and always liked JBL products; they usually hit my listening sweet spot, regardless of the genre of music, so as a brand loyal customer I ordered a set of over-ear JBL headphones, the JBL Tune 510 BT.  I’m not sure what the model numbers mean,  but when I first put them on and listened to them I had a “wow” moment, and said “these are keepers”.  They are comfortable, they stay put on my ears when I’m working in the shop, they block out a lot of background noise, and they reveal so much more within the music than I was used to, ever knew existed, or was even hoping for.  I can’t say with certainty that the headphones hit the highest highs or  the lowest lows, but the overall presentation is complex, colorful and pleasing. They leave me wanting for nothing.  I’m entertained now with “active hearing”, as I can discern so much more depth of sound with these headphones. I fully enjoy them  such that I even wear them while preparing meals.  They would get 10 stars if they also made me a better cook.  But that’s just not gonna happen under any circumstance. At least I still have the headphones to fall back on.

I don’t know if I’ll ever travel with them, but they fold kinda flat, which seems like a nice feature, although not a dealbreaker for me.  My quest started out about the quality of sound, and that’s where it ended when I purchased the JBL Tune 510BT headphones.  I’m satisfied that I can cross that quest off my to-do list.",5,B08WM1V5P1,2024,the United States

R37QRZK48IG7XZ,Love These,"I bought these for the noise cancellation and to listen to music when I cut grass. I’ve tried ear buds but they just don’t cancel the sound of a lawnmower.
Pros;
1. The sound/bass is perfect
2. The noise cancellation I give it 9 out of 10 stars.
3. Functions; The various functions are responsive and works well
4. Price was great for the headphones
5. With the noise cancellation, I didn’t have to turn the volume on my iPhone to hear my music. That’s a plus on saving my hearing.

Cons;

The sound quality is great as well, all for a great price! They’re also very stylish and I bought accessories for them!",5,B08WM1V5P1,2024,the United States
R2EOPTP40QLKHD,Comfortable!,"Perfect audio for any audio buff.

Fits perfectly to multiple shaped/sized heads (we tried them on multiple family members and got perfectly each time). Have work for up to 2-3 hours at a time while excersizing and never felt ""headphone fatigue"" nor did it bother my ear piercings causing soreness.
Noise cancelling at any level. Being hard of hearing, I listen to my music loud. My husband medium level. Either way, definitely noise cancelling from any outside distractions.

Has a LONG battery life. Use daily for 1-2 hours at a time (give or take) strictly listening to music. Took a little over a couple months use before needing recharge.

Easy to connect to your Bluetooth devices. Used for phone and tablet use.

RAE9R8SHEJSOM,"Ordered (not delivered, mind you) on 30th August, Left Earpiece stopped working on 26th October","I'll keep it direct, sound quality is very admirable for the price. Noise isolation, again, is just short of perfect for the price. The orange ear-tip combined with great finish of material indeed make them stand out and look reliable. Unfortunately, not sturdy as they look.

The left earpiece stopped working even before reaching 2 months of usage, and there is no visible damage or scuffing anywhere on the earphones. The weird thing is, when such things happens, it usually happens at the solder points/joints of the wire and you can sorta pin-point the location of failure by inspecting and twisting the cable on each joining spots to see when it starts working. But here, it didn't happen at all.

One might say that it might be my use case scenario, but I have used all my earphones past 7 years the same way as I always do, and none of the others (SoundMagic ES-18 and E10BT, Sony SBH20 and XB30AP, Xiaomi Capsule, OnePlus Bullets etc) have failed before 1 year, even when facing serious abuse and absurd handling, much more brutal than how these JBLs were treated.

JBL is supposed to be the unsung hero of sound industry, looking out for the little guy, but I guess what they say about stars, ""those who burn the brightest live the shortest"" and I think the asking price for the sound quality and comfort was just too steep to maintain the build quality of the earpieces.",1,B01MG62Z5M,2018,India

R27WY1MJS0IS9X,It's going to be a detailed review about my experience. Read on patiently before buying this.,"The first time I bought this product it was defective. Had it returned. Placed a new order. The second time, the left side stopped working after 5 months.

But the worst part is the after sales service. Read some of the other reviews about the service center, and I couldn't agree more. JBL's after sales service is pathetic to say the least. At least their Kolkata service center is. JBL's India support email and phone service aren't great either. They promise to reply within 24 hrs to mails, but I didn't receive any reply even after 5 days. The JBL helpline is also mostly busy. But one time when I did talk to them and told them that I had been unable to reach the service center, they replied to me with an email saying ""Please contact the service center. They will be happy to assist you."" A round of applause for the reply.
Anyway after all this, I was told to mail the product to their service center in Kolkata. So I did. And I wanted to know whether it has reached them. But there was no way to know it. The email provided me in the name of service center's id also replied to me with ""Please contact the service center"". That doesn't even make sense. Nobody answers the mobile phone either.

Service center's landline number is busy most of the times or nobody picks up. And one time that they did pick up, the executive was quite rude and arrogant. She has no idea how to talk to people/customers. She outright said to me that it will take 15 days minimum and told me that I should've known that before sending them the product. And that was it.

This was my worst experience as a customer. Amazon executives couldn't help me too. This will be my first and last JBL product. Buying a JBL is now a matter of luck - if it works for a long time then it's well and good but if it doesn't, get ready to be harassed and waste a lot of your time that they don't value.",3,B01MG62Z5M,2018,India

R3DMV5UCK65JTF,Excellent Sound Quality!,"These headphones are by far, the best we've ever used, and between the 7 of us, we've had many different makes at varying prices. The sound quality is excellent, and as they are noise cancelling, you need to have the music
etc, blasting, just to drown out any/all external noise. the stability of sound is fantastic, too, unlike some others we've had.
Having different sized ear pieces, is really handy, especially if you have super tiny ear holes, like me. The smallest size fits me perfectly, and they don't feel loose, painful, or like they're about to fall out.
They're extremely durable, which is a must when our teenagers are being, shall we say, typical teenagers...?!
Mine are used for listening to all different genres of music, learning Korean, watching movies, etc, and there has never been any issues with hearing everything crystal-clear. The deep base is definitely one of my favourite additions. Phone calls are crystal-clear too, from both ends, as the microphone picks up your voice easily. The cute little button is handy, and I've never had any problems when answering calls, playing music, etc.
My one teensy tiny wish is that they'd come in even more colours, e.g, lavender/lilac, to match my phone... but, that's just an aesthetic thing, as it hasn't stopped me buying this 3rd pair (my 1st pair I'd had for 3yrs, and I still didn't have any problems, but one of our children needed some, and yes, I did clean them properly etc. The 2nd pair was bought specifically for another one of our children).
When you consider the fact I've also had to purchase a usb type-c converter, just so I can continue to use these with my Galaxy S23 Ultra! It definitely shows how much I love them!
I 100% recommend these to anyone and everyone. You won't be disappointed.",5,B01MG62Z5M,2023,the United Kingdom

R2ALU4IODE0VMZ,JBL won my heart.....!,"Don't think...! Just buy this amazing product.
Build quality is one of the best out there. I am really impressed with extraordinary build quality of this product. The flat cable is amazing. Every part of this earphone is finely made. Even the JBL branding looks fantastic. It comes with 3 sizes of earbuds that will just perfectly fit your ear.
And Sound quality... Man, you just have to listen to experience this. The bass just amazing and the balance between Bass, Treble and Loudness is just perfect. All over sound is pleasant to hear.
Big thumbs up for JBL.
And very good service by amazon as always.
So if you're looking for earphones under 1000 rupees, get this one without a doubt.
Beware of fake ones out there. You can find exactly same product, with same box for around 300-400 in the market, but it's not original.
Please give this review a thumbs up if you find it helpful.
Thank you",5,B01MG62Z5M,2017,India

Regarding its fragility that is mentioned in a number of comments, that must concern the old model, as on https://www.amazon.nl/JBL-universele-hoofdtelefoon-afstandsbediening-microfoon/dp/B06VWPCYFD/.

I took it into backup role - was impressed myself for the clear audio, flat cable and 'almost-L' jack below 10€. Glossy plastic - spoils impression a bit.

RW3G3Q0TE0CLX,"6/10 sound quality, poor construction, designed to fail?","These are not the best sounding headphones.  They are just a 6 out of 10, which is expected for the price.  They lack critical detail and muddle a wide assortment of frequencies.  If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with high compression coming from the audio section of the Bluetooth receiver because the sound quality resembles 128kbit or lower mp3 compression.  Even the cheapest Bluetooth audio receivers are capable of higher bandwidth which can be set through firmware.  It as if they needed to degrade performance to make the higher models ""better"" through settings.  On top of that, the speaker diaphragms are incapable of complex music reproduction.  They are heavily-dampened (too heavy, too stiff and subsequently too slow to react/accelerate; made for bass and distorted sizzle sounds but not much else), and mainly optimized for low quality, generic-mainstream-cookie-cutter-tunes-lacking-in-melody-and-full-of-rythmic-mind-programming-satanic-overtones that will not be remembered a decade from now.  Basically, it impresses teenagers.

As far as comfort, yeah they grip and press on the ears if you have a large head. But it's on-ear, so it's to be expected.  At least the ear pads are super soft.

Regarding build quality, maybe JBL thinks we're stupid, but right out of the box I could see red flags all over the poorly engineered swivels.  They're made of a thin, frail plastic that will break-off within a matter of months of normal use.  Engineers don't create flawed designs that bad unless their bosses specifically mandate it.  Just adding a few pennies worth of 1mm to 2mm thicker material around the wall of the swivel would have fixed the problem.  But that's probably inconceivable to the sociopathic penny-pinching corporate types at JBL.

I can't believe JBL would sink so low.  They used to over-engineer everything, even their cheap stuff.  It's insulting and downright disrespectful. They've adopted the same unsustainable business model practiced by a certain shortsighted country in the far east, so they can bilk their customers, make quick bank while also becoming irrelevant in the not too distant future.",1,B08WM298TV,2024,the United States
R1EDPK3RPLCK7C,Disappointment,"I bought this headset in Black Friday with a good discount. I didn't need anything fancy, just decent sound, micro, and battery. This ticked all those boxes.
The problem is that it keeps losing bluetooth connection. Or more specifically, it seems to remain connected but no sound in or out of it. If I turn it off and on, it doesn't find pairing devices. After a long time off it works fine again, for a few minutes. This happened occasionally in the beginning but now it happens practically every time.
Never again JBL.",1,B08WM1V5P1,2024,Canada
R3NI1WJJJM1QNK,Headphones lasted 4 months. Died. Customer support was not acceptable,"I liked the sound. If it only had lasted. It didn't. So I called the customer support number. The first guy said to hold as he was going to make a case number for me. Then we were disconnected. He had my phone number but never called back. So I called again. The woman who I worked with was very nice and we got to the part where they replace the product. They demand that you send the piece of junk back before they will replace it. Why? It's not any good to anyone. If they look at my buying history, which I'm sure they would never bother to do, they would see that I don't give one star reviews and I don't scam people asking for replacements. But...don't trust those dishonest customers. So I said forget it. I'm 74 and getting to the post office is a real hassle for me. So I said forget it. The produce was on sale, and a new model came out, so I have to ask if they weren't selling the last of a bad batch to clear their inventory.",1,B08WM3LMJF,2024,the United States

I went online to search for clues to no avail. However, I discovered both of my sons could connect no problem.  My mom and I have android my sons have Apple. Is this why? IDK. I didn't see in the description it's only compatible with Apple. I decided to put a positive spin on it and let the kids keep it as an extra, but when the time came to charge it, no type of charger end would fit and I had to write a warning review. Can it only use the charger it came with ( I don't remember if it came with one..) but if so even that would be a hassle to replace it if lost etc. So either these headphones are only compatible with Apple and will only charge with the unique charging cord that comes with it or I have a defective product.

It hasn’t even been 1 month since I’ve bought these and have been using them and they don’t even work anymore! They connect to my devices perfectly fine, but once connected it doesn’t even play the audio on my phone consistently anymore. Feels like a charger that only works at a certain angle, these headphones only play audio from my phone whenever it wants WHICH IS BARELY EVER ANYMORE. Ps, I don’t think it’s bc I damaged them bc they’ve never been near water, are also folded and carefully stored and looks like it did when I bought it. Honestly I’d recommend saving your money and investing in some skullcandies or Sony’s. Super disappointing but what could you expect right",1,B08WM1V5P1,2024,Canada
R18S4OWQLLCBTP,Broke within 4 weeks,"Bought these in February 2023, broke within 4 weeks. Amazon initially gave me contact information for JBL support but it was JBL USA, so wasn't useful whatsoever. Once they figured out that I was in Canada, they told me who to contact and that was also useless because they want the serial number which they stated is on the box. Well by the time I was in contact with JBL Canada, I no longer had the box, or serial number.

Cannot get support for warranty now. Wouldn't recommend nor would I spend money on JBL again.

Well, I got another pair (as a gift) in december, and made sure not to sleep on them, and be really really gentle. Currently I am unable to connect them to any of my devices. While the headphones worked they were genuinely amazing, both in sound quality and in comfort. Both pairs would occasionally have trouble connecting, but nothing extremely concerning.

However, a few days agog I had to bend over very quickly and as they started to slip off my head, I reached up to them very quickly to keep them from falling off my head. The right pad snapped where it met the over head band.  They just dangled thereafter making them essentially useless for listening.

Headphones are kinda bad when it comes to use as they have around 1-3sec sound lag canot as synce you can connect only by blu2 it takes ages to connect them to every diferent device would take like 2sec using cable. overal i do not recomend unles you want to be forced to buy new one in 2-5 years cause thats a battery lifespawn 500 charging cycles thats what you giet. it would last lifetime if they could connect by cable. my walkman sony headphones are over 30 years old and still works on cable no need to worry abouth battery or anoying beeping and remainding of ""low battery please charge""",1,B08WM3LMJF,2023,the United States

R12OO8JOD0RCKN,Misleading product description — NO 3.5mm headphone jack!,"I just received these today and unboxed them to charge them before use, but upon first inspection it was revealed that the product description, based up which I bought them, is not truthful.

In the product description here it says “headphones Jack” and then lists “ ‎3.5 mm Jack” as an inclusion — this is untrue. In fact, the headphones are Bluetooth ONLY, and the only port on them is for a usb-c charging cable.

Maybe this isn’t a big deal to a lot of buyers, but for me it was one of the biggest reasons I ordered the headphones. This is because there are often times that a Bluetooth connection simply isn’t available — on most airplanes, using older music devices like iPods or traditional stereo systems, etc. Because of this I wanted a new, quality set of headphones that could be wired or wireless, and JBL misled me into buying these.

They obviously will be returned even though I’d like a nice, quality Bluetooth over ear pair, but I thought other possible buyers should be aware. Or beware, I guess…",1,B08WM3LMJF,2023,the United States

I'm sticking with Sound Core and Anker products from now on. Shame on you JBL for giving in to cheap manufacturing techniques. This is far beneath what I expected of you.

UPDATED: So I'm sitting here in the wee hours of the morning listening to YT through these.  I love early morning because it's so quiet.  I bought these so I could be up early and be able to listen to YT or other things on the internet and not disturb others sleeping.  Now I notice some 'tapping' in my right headphone.  It sounds like rain dripping from a rain gutter.  It's very annoying.  I can only hear it if nothing is playing.  I flipped the headphones around and it's definitely only coming out of the right headphone.  It would be nice if these things were absolutely silent when nothing is playing.  It would be even nicer if we could get a product these days that actually works.  I was hoping for better from JBL.  I already threw out the box so no returning these.",1,B08WM3LMJF,2022,the United States

R2YJWEQOE59IKM,Terrible Audio Quality,"I bought these for gaming just so I could hear the game while using a separate microphone. Among my other issues, these are much smaller than I thought they were.
First serious issue was that even when I selected my mic as my audio input, these headphones got in the way.
Second issue was while it was trying to use the headphones as a mic (I didn’t know it had one, that’s why I bought them), the microphone quality was choppy at best.
Third issue was the audio in the headphones cuts out CONSTANTLY. I read in another review that it’s the headphones’ ear detection turning audio off because it doesn’t detect and ear, but it does this CONSTANTLY.
These are practically unusable and I plan on sending them back for a refund.",1,B08WM3LMJF,2023,the United States

I've reset them, forgotten the device, etc. If I'm listening to something and pause it, when I press play again they won't work. It says it's connected but no sound comes out. And it does this when connected to multiple devices so it's not the device.

RUMRBJ5SXOANJ,On ear vs. Over ear,"First of all, these headphones must have been designed with a child in mind. I don't have a large head yet, even when fully extended, these were STILL way too tight. The audio quality was marginal at best, but for around $25.00, my expectations were pretty low. Also, if noise cancelation is important to you, don't bother with any "" on ear "" headphones. By definition, they don't cover your ears but rather, sit on top so outside noise will definitely leak through. If you're not a fan of earbuds ( which I'm not ) your best bet is to go with the "" over ear "" variety. They're much more comfortable to wear ( depending on the brand, of course ) and definitely block out more outside noise.",1,B08WM3LMJF,2023,the United States

I know I don't just have a dud, because after googling the issue, I see many others have experienced the same.

It's not professional quality but for a bluetooth pair at this price, the frequency range is great and I can hear all the details. Compared to ANY of the off-brand generic headphones from Amazon at this price range (around $40), it's night and day. These are way better. So I'm giving 2.5 starts because of that.

Now, the ugly side: it is SO UNCOMFORTABLE. They are VERY small which makes them really tight even if you have a regular-sized head. The ear cuffs are tiny due to being on-ear and it hurts my ears after only a few minutes of use. If you are going to use them for any reasonable amount of time, it will hurt. Trust me. It feels like those are kid-sized. Not comfortable at all.

Also, these are bluetooth 4 and the charging port is not USB-C which indicates this is an older model.

What I did not like is
They are too stiff as a fit , after a while they kind of press into your ear loafs and this is not at all comfortable
My other pee wee is that the microphone on these is not efficient as the bluetooth connection keeps dropping when on a voice call.

R362QBKTCGVGI,Apple) and these are excellent. Perfect for those that are athletically active with ...,"I've read the reviews and felt compelled to write one myself since I'm a recent owner of the Bose SoundSport Free headset. Many of the reviews have been one side or the other - not conducting a 'full' test or providing a comparison (specifically when pointing out faults), with little insight as to what the 'user' is looking for from an experience standpoint. With that said, here's my high-level review...

I'm running Firmware version 1.4.5

Audio:
Superb. I own several headsets (Sony, Beats, Sennheiser, Bose, Apple) and these are excellent. Perfect for those that are athletically active with sound that's delivered crisp and clear, pleasing bass fans such as myself. Comfort level is outstanding and controls are relatively easy to use (some effort pushing the buttons and there is a slight delay on the actual volume control adjustment time, though not a big deal). These are not noise cancelling, but if you're someone for example who jogs where cars are, etc., these block out enough sound, but let in enough noise to keep you cognizant of your surroundings. 5 stars here for the use their intended for (they are named &#34;SoundSport&#34;).

Video Audio:
Yes, there is a delay - but here is where it resides. If you're using your Phone or Tablet to watch video on a site like YouTube, you most likely will notice the delay in voice to mouth (on either an LTE or WiFi network connection). It's aggravating. However, when I run the same video on a laptop or desktop - there's no delay (same WiFi network). If you have a video that is downloaded, you will not notice a delay at all, no matter the device. With that said, if you're an avid YouTube watcher who uses a phone or tablet for those videos - I'd recommend against purchasing these. 4 stars here - and less if you're someone who streams video to one of the device types I mentioned.

Case/Quality/Battery/Comfort/Conectivity:
Typical Bose quality - very good to excellent. In ear the buds are extremely comfortable and the battery meets the Bose listed duration time. The case is great (though it will never beat the Apple AirPod case - but again nothing will), charges quickly, and easy to pack away and not worry about charging for the day. Connecting to devices is simple, and the Bose app will update the firmware of the buds over bluetooth - convenient for even the non-technical person. I haven't personally experienced any drops, which have been reported by others, but I wouldn't doubt those issues usually due to interference - something that simply can't be avoided (though some may be worse than others). 4.5 stars here because it's not the Apple AirPod case.

Overall:
I'm giving these a 4 star rating because they're not perfect for all intended use. While it covers most of what I personally intend to use these for, it's disappointing to witness issues right out of the box regarding video audio delay on portable devices. This issue can be remediated via a software update, but I'd recommend that Bose properly test out 'all' device streaming before releasing future updates. If you're someone who plans to just use these specifically for the audio experience of music, then I'd highly recommend them. You won't experience the drag of wires, uncomfortable ear hooks, or the concern that they may fall out. To summarize, great for those athletically active or music-holics looking for a smaller footprint to carry around, and bad for those looking for a great 'streaming' video experience on 'portable devices.'",4,B0748G1QLP,2018,the United States

This is the first true wireless earbuds from Bose so it's not perfect. The left earbud would occasionally lose audio signal; the battery life of the earbuds could be longer, or as least charge faster; the design/size of the buds could be smaller/sleeker.

The only negative aspect is the buttons.  I feel they are a little too hard to depress.
I also feel there should have been a more comprehensive user manual.

R1HEF64MYVFK3,"Fantastic Sound, Fantastic Feel, just some points to note..","Fantastic sound you expect from BOSE is this product. Comfortable fit also. Love them and love the charging case. Feels like a premium product. Would highly recommend.

I do have a few things I wasn’t a fan of: When using them for a phone call,  conversation  can only be heard in the right ear. This was listed as a feature for some reason. Prefer to hear a caller in both my ears like with the other wireless BOSE headphones that are available which I own (BOSE Soundsport Bluetooth wireless in ear headphones and BOSE Quiet comfort II) The person I’m speaking to can hear me perfectly clear which is good though.  Other thing not a fan of is when playing music loud, apparently people next to me can hear my music therefore sound leakage is evident. Nothing major though and I’m sure just the norm when it comes to earphones. Nobody mentioned anything about my other headphone usage though. Final point is BOSE share play feature, they can’t be used with these earphones if this is a feature you have used previously etc.

Overall, I would recommend these, they look nice, sound fab and love the charging case. I’m looking forward to BOSE noise cancelling version coming out in 2020.",5,B0748JM8M5,2019,the United Kingdom
R12EZEVXT4ZZS,A great quality product,"What a wicked little pair of earphones
The pros
I have had my earphones for the last two months and I use them on a daily basis the sounds quality is outstanding with full range of the sound spectrum with really good base and crisp top end great for watching films on my iPad.
I use them when I’m at the gym when I’m on the spin bikes as I’m currently training as a endurance cycling I just par up my earphones to my iPhone and listen to my music and miles seem to just melt away as the noise cancelling is very good and I can’t hear the background noise of the gym of everyone grunting and groaning.
The battery life is very good I normally get around three hours of using on a full charge it doesn’t take too long to recharge them once they are flat so I can’t really fault these headphones they are great value
The cons
I’ve found if I haven’t used my headphones for a couple of days the base (box) will lose its charge even thou its was fully charged when I left them!
I found that the earphones stuck out from my ears a little bit to much for my liking where other headphones seem to be a bit more flash or in the ear but I think it’s more down to personal preference",5,B076SDS2MD,2020,the United Kingdom
RG9FK6E986A76,THE BEST BLUETOOTH EARBUDS,"Was always a fan of Bose and own several other products.

And there are a lot of new competitors with touch functionality, longer battery life, lot of options on the app etc and cheaper than Bose..... Plus I heard and saw many reviews about the video lag on soundsport free .....Until i stumbled upon limited offer on these .... The cheaper price made me jump and order one pair.... Got it super fast.... Packaging, fit, comfort, sound all bloody awesome...... Did a quick firmware update automatically and voila no lag in you tube, Netflix and any video....... Love it....... The only thing is phone calls play only on one bud.... But if you were using a phone it would be the same anyways... You would listen only through one ear....",5,B0748JM8M5,2020,Australia
R281EKI57EUQ94,Great Product despite a rocky start.,"They came with the newest revision of the updates, which are the newest release of the model(make sure you get the newer version and you will save yourself a lot of headaches.

First and foremost these are for Music and Fitness- you can tell by the design choices and the marketing materials - I would seriously not take anyone's review into account unless that is the sole focus on the review. These are for use with a Cell Phone not a PC or MAC.

Sound Quality is absolutely amazing for wireless earbuds considering your other options - they are the top of the stack for quality of sound hands down(The Beats version comes in at around tie to slightly lower quality)  - If this is your priority don't look back. Otherwise wired is always better obviously. There is slight aberrations from the processing of the sound but that is expected otherwise the profile is good for wireless. Bass is good, mid range is solid and highs are there but don't get to the point they are ear piercing focused. Very loud - If your phone is all the way up in most medium environments you will probably have them around half volume.

Connectivity - no problems whatsoever, but be aware the left earbud can time out which makes it seem like it isn't connected, also you will get drops around extremely strong radio waves and will cause drops primarily in the left ear, mine never cut out despite using them at the business/working end/side of the airport where radio signals are all over the place with missive congestion on the radio wave spectrum. Don't expect to use these and walk away they are meant to have a cell phone carried with you -another thing to keep in mind from others reviews.

The design sits in the ears with a twist and is comfortable without any kind of slipping out despite the design of being bulky compared to other options. Could not shake them out even tried a headbang metal session which is weird despite not having foam eartips. It is larger compared to other options but manages to not fatigue the ears that much.

Got 6 hours of battery life out of them with 2.5 additional charges from the case, honestly at that point battery is moot unless you are going camping for a week, on standby 5 days without the charge.

Water resistant to sweat and water but not to be submerged - this makes it easier to wear when raining without fear or sweat from workouts and makes for easy cleanup - but use common sense and they should be 100% fine.

Okay now for the pitfalls.

Video audio sync is terrible unless you are playing video from Apps, you need to watch what codecs are being used and just be aware this is not the prime focus of this device. YouTube app itself is fine but access it from the web page and.....well just don't I would imagine its the same way for any streaming service, need to test it with Amazon video/Funimation/Netflix/Hulu and the other streaming services. Something tells me the apps are fine but webpage streams are bad depending on codecs used.

There are physical buttons on the ear pieces and man the play/pause/skip/… is hard to push, Volume buttons aren't terrible but still bad, these needed to be a bit more user friendly, a touch pad on the exterior shell would have been better.

On calls the design choice was only to use the master ear piece rather than have audio come from the set of buds. +/- depending as you can use it old style with just the master while walking around.

No active noise cancelation that Bose is famous for - Passive is terrible - design choice probably for runners and cyclists.

Next revision - Bose needs to change for these to be an absolute home run

Size is fine and so is the shape.
No physical buttons instead touch input for audio controls.
non-proprietary USB type C charging for the case instead of Micro USB 2 is this pre 3.0 2000's??? using outdated standards on a premium product is an absolute no-no for what you are charging for these. Wireless charging??? Power share???
New eartip options meant to satisfy Passive NC requirements to open up type of consumer base.
Bose's famous ANC would be nice as well. - Runners and cyclists can turn it off but if its never there that isn't an option...
Ideally if they change a few things and nail the connectivity/Codec issues and then change a few outdated aspects these would be a $250-$300 set of premium earbuds but the features and product needs to warrant that price.",5,B0748G1QLP,2019,the United States
R39LO7MREUX5QP,GREAT earphones,"I had always wanted these earphones and I decided to order them.
The sound is great. The product seems to be up to Bose standards - I have only used them for a few days.
Bose is a great company and all their products I own (speakers, earphones and ear buds) are spectacular. A must have.",5,B0748JM8M5,2021,Japan
R2Z3JB7OCY319Y,Complete Quality,"I have several Bose headphone including the QC30 and have recently purchased the SoundSport Free.  My thoughts after a month:

Weight.  Some speak of them as being heavy in the ears, this is not the case.  I have relatively small ears and these fit well and do not protrude as much as people claim.  They seal well, the wing tip supplied are by far the best I have used with many similar products.  Even after a whole day listening these are fine.  I don't do the gym but do walk my dog, there is no wind noise, they do a great job at isolating ambient noise.

Battery Life.  Superb, I listen all morning, put them back in the case while I eat lunch and they are good to go for the whole afternoon.  The simplicity of the charging via the case is a dream, the magnetic recess which holds them in the case is a nice design.  Some say the case is too large but I have not found it all bulky in the front pocket of jeans an chinos.

Sound Quality.  For me this is the most important factor, I follow the ethos of testing headphones by listening to tracks I know well, and I have done this with these, they offer very crisp clear audio, warm and very pleasing depth with good bass, a very powerful soundstage, there is a purity to them that I think is beyond compare with many more expensive wireless earphones and earbuds.

Style & Build Quality.  The colours on offer are funky, the buttons are quite small but easy to get used to but they are definitely not so hard that you have to remove them from your ears to use the options.  I very easily updated them via the Bose support site to the latest software upgrade, it was a necessary upgrade for phone-call quality and a doddle to do.

Overall - This is a quality product that will hold its place in the wireless earbud market for a long time to come.  There are clearly Bose lovers and hater, if you are a hater, you are unlikely to be reading this review, for the lovers, adding these to their range has been a triumph.  Expensive, maybe, but quality always is.",5,B0748G1QLP,2018,the United Kingdom
R27RKPCO2Y0HYT,Fantastic earphone at a price,"2 year update
------------------
Just as I predicted, gen 2 of this model didn't come out for 2 years and counting and the earphone is very affordable, ragning from $169-$209 for sales. Also heads up that next generation of wireless earbuds will be coming 2020, Bose Earbuds 500 and Bose Noise Cancelling Earbuds 700. They will definitely be more expensive based on historical trend of Bose with their new products the way this earbuds costed $329 on initial launch, so you have a risk free choice to make.

7month reflection (July 6-2018)
-------------------------
The price is now $249 compared to $329 when I first got them, which is more affordable, so this is now where you need to use your best judgment to go with cheaper competing brands or go with this one as typical technology upgrade cycle time is about 1year~1.5 year (cellphones especially). I don't think generation 2 of this product will come out any time soon as soundsport wireless earphone (the other popular Bose product that has wires between earbuds) came out way earlier than this product but still has no generation upgrade. For $249, it is worth the price but this is something I've been thinking since the soudsport wireless (not this product but the one that shares similar Frankenstein nail on ears design as this Soundsport free earphones) and that is they can do much better with the design somehow because as a long time Bose fan it's hard to justify the design that is just not comfortable for active movement-based activities (it's irony because they advertise it as a sports accessory but when you actually wear it, the weight of the device makes it go up and down mildly while jogging or rope skipping...it doesn't come out but just having to worry about it is what annoys me) which is why I hope the 2nd gen does make it lighter and more compact design. However, I can tell you with confidence that if you're looking for something that looks cool and premium with great sound, you're looking at the right product.

--------------------------------------
1 week of use (Important: make sure you do firmware update which seems to fix most of the issues that caused low rating for early adapters)

So I've been using it for a week including home + outside commute + gym and here are my updated thoughts.

1) 'truly' no wire is awesome
Wired to wireless is definitely a great jump but having no wires at all is so comfortable. This truly wireless is at its 1st gen at the moment and by 2-3rd gen, price will drop and things will become more common.

2) sound is amazing but it is not noise cancelling. it performs ok on pop, ballad and great on hiphop as well as classical. Bass is top notch. You can still kind of hear what's happening outside and won't be feeling that isolation QC series does. It is not a negative point because that is not the intent of this product and price is justified from its truly wireless technology and charging capsule.

3) It stays sturdy in your ear. I am using default medium stayhear tips and it doesn't shake or dangle at all during running or other exercises. However, it does go up and down I can feel during rope skipping which made me feel a bit uncomfortable as in it does stay in your ear fine, but I feel distracted that it might come off. I hope next gen makes the earpiece thickness reduced by 30-40% at least to resolve this awkwardness.

4) Signal drop issues have been resolved based on December firmware patches and that's my belief because I never came across drops except when I was a bit far away from sourcing cellphone.

The question is, is price of $329 CAD justifiable? personal thoughts.
-This earphone is about $50-100 higher price than major competitors at truly wireless segment. Here's some things you pay for in exchange for competitors'.
a) stayhear tips - one of the most comfortable ear tips in my audiophile life and using other brands typically require comply foam purchases that incur extra costs in the long run the way my previous earphone did. Earphone foams are important for high level audios for sound isolation and cost of buying does pile up. Bose stayhear doesn't need that.
b) charging container lasts two charges with earphone having decent battery
c) Bose customer service - There are retail outlets out there and they're known to solve your problem fast and reliably including easy exchange/refunds compared to bad situations I had to go through with others.
-----------------------------------------------
Been a long Bose fan since QC15 days and it'd be my first truly wireless earphone. Purchased as my recent sports wireless earphone broke. Amazon.com reviews are horrible due to off-sync and call drop issues but they have been fixed mostly since December 2017 firmware update and at least so far I have not had any issues with such. Video works fine, youtube's fine, Netflix haven't tried.

1. Box

Study and magnetic. Box is fairly small and includes everything in a compact manner.

2. Hardware quality

Feels very premium and luxurious. Bose did come up with some weird designs occasionally and this one happens to be more on the premium look and less experimental. Further polished based on original soundsport wireless.

It comes with two earpieces, charging cable and most importantly, the charging container, which makes it distinctive from soudsport wireless besides it being truly wireless.

3. Sound quality

I use Westone 4R, Bose QC25 as a baseline and it's one of the best for sure at its price range as an wireless earphone. Bass is definitely one of Bose's specialties and it definitely does not fail us this time either. Treble/bass balance is decent I personally feel. Guitar riffs sound great as well while Westone sounded clearer but I am talking about quad driver wired earphones. Sound feels very safe and not very adventurous for mainstream users (while price itself is not mainstream). Isolation is decent and sound feels well separated among instruments.

4. Comfort

One of my concerns were what if it's too heavy and contrary to my doubts, it doesn't feel heavy on the ears and can wear for a long time while I still advise occasional breaks. Stayhear eartips are what makes Bose earphones so special and is very comfortable on the ear. It fits in the ear very perfectly and does not come loose at all. It comes with small and large sizes as well for your convenience.

I will update this product more as I use it but so far it has been amazing. The fact that there is no wire makes so much difference. Only downside of course is hefty entry price of $329 CAD but come to think of it, compared to current bluetooth earphones out there, you get to try the latest technology as of present (truly wireless) + it comes with a charging container, which justifies its price at least relative to current competing bluetooth earphones of $100-250 range out there + Bose's name and customer support which is very good compared and reliable in overall based on my personal experience being assisted with QC25.",5,B0748JM8M5,2017,Canada

They've been really great. They can reach plenty of bass and high without distorting the sound. I love the fact that they connect automatically once out of the box. I'm using these headphones with an iPhone 11.
The wind hasn't affected the connection yet. They are not noise cancelling but I don't mind at all.",5,B076SDS2MD,2020,Australia
R1W6CQTQU657KQ,Amazing sound quality!!,"I read a lot of reviews and compared a lot of products before buying these. I am 100% sure its the best that I have bought. Few concerns about people not being able to decide.

1. Sound quality is at par with a bose over-ear headphone such as QC 35. It truly is. I own both and so can tell. So rest assured in that regard.

2. Lot of remarks about getting disconnected and not being able to pair. Most reviews pointing those issue out are old. New updates on the firmware (mine was pre-installed with it) seem to have taken care of it. I have had no issue using multiple devices.

3. Reviews comparing and complainign about range. I have had no issue or drop even after being away from my phone behind 2 different rooms and 2 set of closed doors.

4. The fit is so good. Bose gives 3 pairs (s,m,l) of earpieces which makes the fit so good that it blocks most of the sound out. For me this was not a priority anyways as i wanted to hear a bit of ambient noise in the gym and outdoor sports where i want to be aware of the surroundings. With higher (50+%) volumes I cant even here the my own treadmill thumps I make.

5. The design lets you do all kinds of gym activities without the fear of the earpiece slipping out due to its design. So far it has not slipped out during chest presses, abs board exercises, running, etc.

6. Concerns about bass being too loud and mids being flats are absolutely untrue. Plus most apps like Spotify, etc have their own eq settings that you can tweak if you are an audiophile. Having said that the sound of these truely wireless headphones will blow you off regardless of whether you use any equalizers.

7. Weird looking gadget, protudes out of the ear too much.. etc etc. I don't see myself when i am wearing these and its not even a compromise you are making against the sound delivered in your ears. Its made my gym experience so much more fun and exciting.

8. The battery life is pretty good. I have not stretched it to its limits but with my use of 50-60 mins a day, i had to recharge the wireless case after 15-16 days which i have no issues with.

The only issue i think are the buttons on the right earpiece. It feels pretty hard for a premium product and there is a slight bit of delay in response from those buttons. So a volume change from the button would probably have a half second delay which i personally don't think is a bit issue. Also, only the right earpiece is engaged for calls and announcements which gives a weird feeling when left earpiece sound just shuts down all of a sudden while hearing music and there is an incoming call.

If you have the budget, and are looking for premium sound, its a no-brainer. If you are looking for a noise cancelling headphones to watch movies, there are better options, but if you are looking for a wireless sports headphone to wear in the gym, you should buy these.

These are returnable on Amazon, so if you don't like them, you can always return, but believe me once you hear the sound out of these, all your concerns will melt away.

From me its a triple major go-for-it !

Note: Ensure that your city has a BOSE authorized service center. Even though amazon officially partners with appario retail (the seller on amazon), if these stop working after the return window is closed, local bose service centers will give you full support on amazon's invoice and warranty certificate during the warranty period.

Good luck",5,B0748JM8M5,2019,India
R1SXAJS4F49F8Q,The king of wireless headphones,"The sound quality of these is second to none (as one would expect since they're Bose), they fit great and stay in whilst doing workouts - I do Insanity/P90X style workouts with lots of jumping/impact which can easily dislodge headphones.

I'd definitely recommend over their main competitors including Apple Air Pods 2 (which look great but cost £250, and the sound, although good, is incomparable since they're the first decent speaker Apple have ever made), and especially headphones like Jabra Elite (comparable in price, good sound quality but Bose blows them away in the audio quality department).

Aesthetically pleasing  (I have the orange as well as the blue/yellow ones), and the battery life is excellent and the charging case is a luxury touch. They also don't seem to scratch when I've dropped them.

Overall world class.",5,B076SDS2MD,2020,the United Kingdom
R3IJG1B0LR0RWX,Best wireless headphones for running yet,"By some way the best wireless buds I have ever had.  Yes they are expensive and have just about no advanced features but they do two things really well - the sound quality is excellent, and the noise isolation is also excellent. With other buds and wired headphones I can hear the sound my feet hitting the road but that does not happen with these, or rather I do not need volume maxed out.

One thing to bear in mind is that you really need to have the charging case plugged in, as the buds will drain even when in the case i.e. don't be fooled into thinking you can go away for 3-4 days with use the case and the buds.  The forward and back button process is a bit fiddly and works less well in the rain.  But not fatal issues at all.

After just over 1 year I noticed the battery life was falling and fell to under 2.5 hours.  Shortly afterwards one of the buds failed to charge at all.  Went on the Bose website, put in the serial number and instantly got the option to return under warranty.  One week later got my new buds. No quibble and no hassle.",5,B0748JM8M5,2020,the United Kingdom
R1LJ3JVHRV9UIT,Unexpected Sound,"First of all, I would like to tell you people can buy this product without any hesitation, also I agreed it’s quite a little bit costly than another true wireless headphone. But I guarantee you my friends once you buy this headphone,  definitely you will be love/fann of this balancing sound with superb bass and real tutor treble,

One thing I feel when I set inside my both the earbud more than 1 hrs, I can feel some pain in my ear. so I can’t listen to the song or watching a movie for not more than 1 hrs. ( This happens with me I think so it’s may not be happen with you bose sound lover friends)

I listen so many different types of earbuds but as compared bose, my all ratings are given below:-

Packaging:- 5/5 ( Royal package by bose)

Sound:- 5/5 (unbelievable)

Bass:- 5/5( Amazing)

The balance between both earbud:- 5/5 ( You can feel like 5.1 with Dolby, especially when you watch a movie)

treble:- 5/5 ( Real tutor no any extra tutor you can feel after listen to the song)

Connectivity:- 5/5 ( within the range which is given in manual, it’s work smoothly no any disturbance  in MP3 songs, no cracking, no frequent connect or disconnect while you walk from 1 room to another room when your phone is connected with Bluetooth )

portability:- 3.5/5 ( If I talk about carrying or portability, its look pretty big in size, especially when you keep it inside your pant/jeans pocket. It’s supposed to manage with a little bit of small size while manufacturing, but it looks so nice, I managed)

Charging:- 4/5 ( I will not give 5/5 cause when you are spending approximately ₹19000/- the company should give at least a travel charger with suitable volt and ampere as same require. The company has given only a data cable for charging. Suppose if I charge with 2.4 Amp and sometimes charge 1.2 Amp . so it will be a bad effect on the battery. So it’s a suggestion from my side only, plz give a specific require volt and ampere adaptor for charging the case )

Charging time:- 5/5 ( Case will fully charge in 1.5 hrs with 2.4Amp adaptor. And 2.5 hrs in 1.2 Amp adaptor)

Backup:- 5/5 ( Superb battery backup you no need to charge within 3-4 days. If you daily use nearly about 3hrs)

Bose Connect app features:- 4/5 ( Great features in-app of “ Find my buds” L&R both. The battery percentage is there in its case. it’s supposed to remain a time charge indicator of headphone. And customized many more with a simple guideline on how to use features.)

Video playback:- 4/5 ( when I watch a movie the sound and video lag of  synchronization. It’s happen all headphone not only bose.  I tried so many headphones it’s a Manageable no issue or no any complaint with Bose)

Swat/ waterproof:- 5/5 (As per the company statement given  IPX4 to prevent sweat or water. I will not or never try in water for testing. So on my side I never face this type of situation on rain or sweat.)

This was my experience with Bose soundsport free truly wireless headphone.

Overall Experience the BOSE will always BOSS in sound. You, people, buy and feel the upgraded and one step ahead sound of this ERA in Bluetooth connectivity.

Thanking you...",5,B0748G1QLP,2019,India
R3L5UK6BV3LK28,Amazing quality at reasonable price,"Amazing sound quality and super comfortable. It may be comparatively expensive, but nothing else can beat the quality of bose products. It's worth the money.",5,B0748JM8M5,2020,Australia
R2P8IOOMGKQCAD,Good lightweight earbuds: with some caveats,"I purchased these after my soundsport wired headphones went missing.

In short I am pretty happy. I haven't noticed any lag or significant dropouts. The exception is youtube: for some reason I see a noticeable delay, but not my other services. Charging case is of solid build & is useful.

Sound quality is of Bose high quality and they are incredibly secure in the ear: I get the feeling that they are there to stay through viqorous exercise.

The only thing to be aware of vs Soundsport Wired is that the SSW's can connect to two devices at once. For example, you can be watching your ipad and still have the iphone connected. When a call comes in the ipad will pause enabling you to take the call.
This functionality does not exist for the Sound Sport Frees. I'm not hugely concerned as it's fairly rare that I needed that functionality: but it's something to be aware of.",5,B076SDS2MD,2019,Australia
R7GYZIO5INCRB,"Perfect Choice, Best Investment for Quality Ear Buds","So i was extremely worried when i purchased these. I read alot of reviews, Most not good reviews. I purchased them, because of the 10 hr play time. You get 10 FULL hrs of Listening time. The charges you get from the rechargeable case do give 30 hrs. You actually get a little more then 10 hrs listening time, and a little more than 30 hrs total, Which in the reviews that i read alot of people didnt receive that. As far as the review i seen the most of, was the left bud cutting out. Ive had the buds for 3 days and if you got more than 35 feet it will start to cut out but it connects back up in less than a second. But anything you walk away from to far its going to disconnect. The one issue i have seen from the day i received the buds are of the charging lights of the case. The last light always stays in the blinking state instead of when its fully charged turning solid. But if you take the buds from the case or use the app They are fully charged 100%. The other reviews ive seen where about if you look on the back of the box, they said they ae only made for iphone, ipod, etc. That is not true. They work beautiful with most all devices, including Amazon Alexa. Now the only other issue is that they do not come with a wall charger. I do believe having to use a wall charger of your own is whats causing the charging light to not turn solid. Alot of reviews mentioned Delays when watching YouTube, movies etc. now that is partly true if you have the video quality to high. and the distance between what device you are using. Now i didnt have any issues with any delay. But when i was trying to get the delay, that is what i found.

They come with 3 sets of changeable ear fits, Small, Medium, Large. which are very comfortable.
Comes with a charging cord.
Of course the Ear Buds
Charging Case.

As far as the sound, Bass, Treble, Mids, highs etc,
The sound is perfectly balanced, You can adjust these with the Connect App or your device.
They have amazing Bass, no crackling, no distortion, PERFECT SOUND that you can adjust if you like.
I am very picky when it comes to sound being right.
I have NO complaints about the amazing sound these Buds put out.
They are very comfortable while in. When you put them in you need to rotate then a tiny bit to get them so sit in, they will not just fall out, it takes some force to make them fall out. Yesterday night i wanted to sleep with them in because my female cat is in heat and i did not want to listen to her calling all night. So i slept with them in both ears, i woke up to them still playing and still in my ears, and i toss and turn all night i always have, When i woke i was amazed to find out they still didnt fall out and they werent uncomfortable, at least for me. Now others will have a different opinion. but the main focus is that they stayed in and were still playing 9 hrs later.
As for the operation buttons [ volume. play, pause, excepting phone calls. I have fat fingers and had no issues operating them while still in my ears, it did not cause issues of them falling out.]
As for sweat and water resistant is true. They arent waterproof.
Taking a Phone call and  having your call hear you, You do not have to raise your voice or yell, you can talk like you normally would. They work excellent during a call.
All in All I am very very happy with the over all performance and the amazing sound quality of these ear buds..
I should only do 4 stars, only because they should come with the wall charger to fix the false showing of not being fully charged.
I would suggest purchasing these ear buds, if you want a good sounding, quality, long lasting Ear buds.",5,B0748JM8M5,2020,the United States
R2ZMK02L6SY5E6,A must-have for audiophiles,"Been on the market for wireless bluetooth earbuds for some time now and I'm so glad that I waited to get these.  I'm a big audiophile and let me tell you that these are worth every single penny!

Sound Quality - Can never go wrong with Bose. Ever.  This may sound silly but I bought my car also simply because of the Bose system so plugging these babies in my ear was like being in my car.  Sound is incredibly clear with the perfect amount of bass.

Connectivity - Was super easy.  You just download Bose Connect app and that's it.  The first time you transmit will take some time but you can do other things while this completes.  Bluetooth range is also pretty impressive.  Left my phone at my desk and walked around the floor and I'd say that the range was about 30 ft or so and was still clear.

Video/Audio lag - Barely any lag if at all when you're watching videos on YouTube or Netflix.

Battery Life - Was 80% charged out of the box and the charging case itself was probably around 20-25% charged.  To get the case fully charged took about an hour to an hour and a half.  At full charge, you'll get about 4.5 hours of battery/listening life which isn't bad at all.

Extra Functions - I have a Pixel 2 and Google Assistant was seamless.  Even while listening to music or watching things, you can still ask Google Assistant anything.  Haven't tried it yet with calls (just got it yesterday) but I can only imagine how seamless that is too.  Controls on the right bud is also easy to use.

Comfort - Comes installed with medium sized earpiece mold and packed with a large and small.  I switched to the small since my ears as small and they are the most comfortable things ever.  Even if you have them in your ears for hours, your ears don't feel sore or anything.  Molds are also perfectly designed that not only do they sit in your ears comfortably, they are very sturdy.  Unless the buds get snagged or you literally pull them out, they're stuck in there.

I'm just really very happy with this investment and would recommend these to anyone especially if you're a fellow audiophile.",5,B0748G1QLP,2019,Canada
RRSALQVI6PI6B,Outstanding,"I own a set of Bose QC35s which I use for commuting and in the office all day. They are the best headphones I have ever owned but I find large headphones completely unsuitable for the gym because, at best, they move around and, at worst, they can fall off.

I previously used the Bluetooth Bose SoundSport headphones (the original model with a wire between the buds) at the gym and was very happy with them. I run 10km on the treadmill most days and the wire around the neck was the only thing I was never totally comfortable with as it often bunched up on one side.

I somehow managed to lose them on holiday and, when considering replacements, saw that the Bose SoundSport Free model had been released. When I read that they were basically identical to the original SoundSport but without the wire it was an easy decision.

I was very worried by the many reviews here mentioning audio lag on YouTube and connectivity issues causing the left bud to cut out. When I opened the headphones, I used the Bose app on my iPhone to update the firmware and have experienced absolutely no issues whatsoever. I can only imagine the people experiencing issues have not taken the time to update their firmware.

In summary, I am completely satisfied with my purchase and thoroughly recommend the Bose SoundSport Free headphones if you are looking for true wireless headphones.

Pros:
+ Comfortable
+ Good battery life
+ Do not move in ear
+ Excellent sound quality
+ No connectivity issues

Cons:
- Protrude from the ear a little
- When making calls, only the right bud works (this is an intentional design decision from Bose)
- Not noise cancelling",5,B0748G1QLP,2018,the United Kingdom
R2Q3UAQ97GNPG8,"Excellent balance of comfort, sound quality and build for indoor/outdoor use","Update - 4 Jan 18: I've watched several YouTube videos and haven't experienced any audio lag of the sort reported by many reviewers. As below, I've applied the firmware update 1.3.2 and it seems to have resolved several of the problems. One issue I have noticed is that when connected to a device, e.g., an iPhone, the buds won't connect to a different device, e.g., my MacBook, unless I manually break the connection. This is annoying and shouldn't happen.

I ordered and received these as soon as they were available, so my review reflects ~ 2 months of use. I did not receive a promotional pair or discount from Bose for this review. I also own Bose QC35 noise cancelling headphones that are used on long flights to create a serene environment. These are not, nor did I expect them to be, noise cancelling. Some reviewers have comments that these buds didn't offer noise cancellation, but Bose never claimed that they did or would.

My first advice to anyone buying the SoundSport Free buds is to upgrade the firmware to the latest version - 1.3.2 at the time of this review. If possible, do it on a Mac or PC (after downloading the Bose Connect app for Mac/PC) with the buds in their charging case. The firmware update will take ~ 10 minutes to complete, vs. about 2.5 hours using the iOS app. The update fixes some of the time lag issues reported with FaceBook, etc., though don't know if the YouTube delay is fixed (I don't use them for that purpose).

The buds are very comfortable for extended use periods, and stay in place far better than Apple or other buds I tried. My use case is typically to use them while working in my home office at my computer, not for watching videos. The sound quality surprised me somewhat, as the base is deeper and more pronounced than on my QC35s or other Bose products I've owned. This isn't a complaint - just an observation. Overall, whether I'm listening to classical, jazz or oldies, the sound reproduction is excellent. They are certainly not heavy and compared to wireless bluetooth headsets, don't seem to me to be &#34;too big&#34;, as some reviewers have claimed. In fact, they feel &#34;just right&#34;.

The buds are also great for my daily walks or physiotherapy sessions (I recently had back surgery). They provide a good seal between the ear and most ambient noise, but not to such an extent that you can't hear on oncoming jogger or your PT coach suggesting that you change positions during an exercise routine. I also appreciate the fact that the amount of external noise is balanced, as I like to walk along the beach and frequently have to share the sidewalk with skateboarders, and I can hear them approaching while still enjoying my music playlist. So, for indoor or outdoor use, I give these a 5+.

Build quality is excellent - exactly what I'd expect from Bose. The charging case is well designed and durable, although I keep mine in a leather carrying case with its micro-USB cable and a small charger I can use if needed. I've used the buds for up to 4.5 hours with ~ 20% power remaining, as indicated by the iOS app, so Bose estimate of 5 hours use is probably accurate. I can't comment on the additional power provided by the case but assuming the battery life estimate for the buds is accurate, Bose estimate of 10 hours for the case is reasonable.

Finally, a comment about the price. Many reviewers have criticized the price, but anyone who's used Bose products for any length of time knows that they are seldom inexpensive. Given the quality, features and sound reproduction of these buds, the price is fair, at least to me. Apple's EarPods aren't inexpensive, either, and don't stay in place as well as these, nor are they as comfortable.

Overall, I am very, very pleased with the SoundSport Free buds, and strongly recommend them on all levels: sound quality, comfort, build and ease of use. I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,B0748G1QLP,2017,the United States
R1ZSOJ39BG02AW,Good quality sound for buds.,"These are the second pair of Bose head / ear phones I have bought. The others being the noise cancelling over ear head phones. There is no noise cancelling feature built into these ear buds but they are far more practical in terms of carrying them around and using them for sports. I've worn them at work in the gym and at home and never had a problem with the audio dropping out, I've actually been quite impressed with the range being able to walk from one room to another and staying connected to my phone.

The charging cradle is small enough and hold enough charge to charge them plenty of times, I'm yet to get caught short in the gym with them dying. I usually charge the cradle once a week.
I would give them a 4/5 for comfort, They aren't as comfy as my over ear ones but I can wear them for 3-5 hours and still not really think about them being there. Best of all, you don't look like that much of a muppet wearing them either.

I think if I lose these or they broke I would buy another pair, I can't say more fair than that.",5,B0748JM8M5,2019,the United Kingdom
R3396WXY7DZMNS,Charge up in advance.,"Not a lot wrong with these, sound is great. The main issue is that the never really turn off, so whenever they aren't in use you need to put them in the carry case to keep them charged. Only problem with that is if you dont use them for a few days, the case will have likely lost it's charge and they will be flat too.
You need to plan ahead for using them, unless they are an every day use for you.
I use them for working out so about 3 times a week, i just stick the case on charge twice a week or so and it seems to work.
For such a good company as Bose this battery draining shouldn't be happening. It does spoil a brilliant product.
I also have the over ear ones, they have no such problem,  but aren't ideal for exercising.",4,B076SDS2MD,2020,the United Kingdom
R12E15RYYV3OLN,"Fantastic sound! Stays in ear, love them! Only issue ""bouncy"" feeling running with them","I have been using these now in the gym for about a week and let me start off by saying that I really do love these!! Totally recommend them and that's why I have given them 4 stars as there is a little issue with them I will explain later!

The pairing was really easy, and they just worked great with my iPod Nano device. The sound quality for me is awesome and even those these are not noise isolation  they do a really good job! When I am in the gym and have the volume up on them I dont hear any of my surroundings.

I am not a runner, so only use these for gym workouts and while weightlifting but they honestly are superb.

So.. what didnt I like about them? The only gripe I have with these is they stick out a bit from the ear. This isnt a big problem until you do any sort of running. Soon as you start running with them there is a &#34;bouncy&#34; feeling in the ear. They never fall out and they have a very good tight fit for me unlike other brands I have tried before. You do get used to the &#34;bouncy&#34; feeling and start ignoring it after 5-10 mins but could have been avoided if the design was more flush with your ear or the weight of the ear piece got reduced.

Also after the firmware update I did the left earbud stopped playing sounds through it. This annoyed me for ages until I held the bluetooth button in for 10 seconds to clear the devices list from the Bose, then I cleared the pairing from my iPod nano. After I did a new sync everything started working again and has been working find since for a few days now. So looks like the left bud got out of sync from the master right side some how. But before you send them back cause of this issue just re-sync them and see if it helps.

So overall, if you are not a runner or dont mind the &#34;bouncy&#34; feeling in your ear then I would recommend them! Yes they are expensive but Bose quality is defiantly shown in this product.",4,B0748G1QLP,2018,the United Kingdom
R1KZCP72BO2L6N,Impressive sound quality and other features but missing some basic functionalities,"Got the true wireless earbuds today. When I opened the packing, the left earbud was not working at all, even though the charging was more than 70%. Then left it to charge and it started working. It’s very difficult to rate such when what works is awesome and what doesn’t is simply pathetic. So here are the pros and cons:

+ first of all sound quality is simply awesome. I don’t think any other brand can match Bose’s sound quality. Bass is deep and you really sink into the music.
+ The video sync issue is not there anymore (read loads of reviews with the same issue but might have been fixed with latest firmware updates).
+ They fit perfectly and the fin design makes sure they don’t come out even when I was running with 12kmph.
+ They also fell very light and you will hardly notice them during workout.

+ The build quality is awesome and inspired confidence that they are durable and can survive some rough handling.

Now the cons:
- I have been trying for whole day but still can’t figure out how to pair them with my windows laptop. I am able to connect but only get voice in right earbud and the voice is mono not stereo (seems belonging to stone ages). Come on Bose even 1000 Rs cheap chinese BT headphones can do that without any issues.

- The left earbud seems to loose connection intermittently. (Though they come back online quickly, but if it happens too frequently it will be definitely annoying).

- The noise cancellation is very disappointing, it catches lot of noise in gym (that might be a good feature for outdoor workout, but cannot ask the gym instructor to turn off all music). It becomes more noticeable if I am listening to Audible and not some high volume music of my own.

Overall: very difficult to recommend or not recommend. Given the awesome sound quality and comfort I’d recommend it. But missing basic functionality such as connecting to Windows, and also lack of decent noise cancellation makes it hard to recommend. I am trying for few more days before deciding whether to keep this or return them.",4,B0748G1QLP,2019,India

R26HZORPEZELRX,"Good quality, small issues","The sound quality is fantastic. I used to have a Jabra Coach and the sound on the Bose is definitely clearer and better. The fact that it’s wireless is also great. The issue I find is that it’s very bulky and, for that reason, it’s easy to knock it out of your ear. I have long hair and whenever I try to tie my hair or move it out of the way, it gets caught and knocks it out of my ear. I also found that I can’t stay in the sun too long with it, it simply turns off. I think it gets too hot. So if you enjoy running outdoors, you might find this a bit annoying too. I think it’s really good quality earphonea overall, but these small details are a bit annoying.",4,B0748JM8M5,2019,Australia
R6URM9V0XPRNB,Not value for money,"Music and sound quality superb, however built quality is very poor, too expensive, BOSE says it is unrepairable.

Update 7/1/19

I've had two sessions with it in the gym,alongside shopping with it....good base line,lasted all day.i was a bit weary about the battery status ,so I placed it in the pod twice,for a short time for a little boast,and when I took it out it was 100% charged up.one of the things ,when on the threadlike,or cross trainer it stayed in my ears...the volume is high enough to place you in your own world,ounce again it's a lot of money,but I feel it's well worth it...

Update 23/7/19

One extremely annoying thing that keeps on happening is the left airpod keeps on switching off,even when they have a lot of charge, however one big positive thing is it can remember up to se seven sources,and when you get a call it speaks out the number.....for the money I still expect 100 percent satisfaction,so I'm withdrawing a point.",4,B0748JM8M5,2019,the United Kingdom

RB6S4H8M4PHC9,Upgrade from A20’s,"Spent 7 years with the A20’s, which were pretty solid performers.  All of that time, my ride was a 737, so multiple cockpits / day … quick exit and set up.  They stood up well, given the abuse.  I did have to replace the entire cord set at year 6, due to a microphone issue (also swapping boom mike from one side to another to give IOE).

New ride, 777 … quieter cockpit.  I didn’t use the supplied ear inserts, opting for custom molds provided by a supplier that works with our company.
Only had the opportunity to use the Pro-Flights on one trip so far, and even if I had 50 trips under my belt - I would say that we don’t wear these very long during the flight, only from pushback up to cruise - then prior to top of descent to the gate.

Having said all that, what I like about the Pro Flights vs the A20’s is the reduced weight on my head.  Along with reduced weight, there is no need to clamp the head either, since this utilizes an in-ear device.

Audio clarity is typical Bose (awesome), and I find that I like the High setting for noise cancelling even though the 777 is very quiet compared to the 737.

I also like that instead of using a screw driver to swap the boom mic (A20’s) from one side to another, the Pro Flight utilizes a simple one handed method to remove the mic set up, producing a much faster switch to the other side.

Less weight, producing less pressure atop the head … along with no head clamping (inherent to A20/30 design), have produced a headset that feels as though it can be worn for long hours, with comfort.",5,B07V395CNF,2023,the United States
R3H41D8MXGKNCE,Excellent quality,"I’m flying a B737 Max and the quality of this headset is superior, lightweight and comfortable. The noise cancelling is perfect. In ear can take some time to get used to it. But I’m in love with these headset",5,B07V395CNF,2024,the United States
RF89TE4WZY7YX,Give it time,"Im editing my previous review of this headset, the first one I got the noise cancellation button was already broken out of the box. Stewed on it for a few month but decided to order another. At first this headset will feel extremely weird and awkward, give it time. Been using them for just over two month now and love it. Nice and light! Tried the A20's again for a few legs and immediately wanted these back. The weight difference is very noticeable. The noise cancellation is quite good as well, I use these in a Q400 and its plenty of noise cancellation. The reason im not giving a full 5 stars is because I wish they were a bit bigger, the adjustment is limited and barely fits my head, so if you have a large head beware these might not fit you.",4,B07V395CNF,2023,Canada
R3RGC64B076YQ6,B-737 approved,"I have been wearing David Clark One-X's for the last 7 years or so.  The noise cancelation on the Pro Flight 2s is equal to or greater than my old David Clark One-X clamps. These Pro Flights are SO comfortable! I am usually averse to having things in my ears (like foam plugs) but these are like wearing airpods for the entire flight. I do not use the ""tap"" feature. I keep the noise cancelation in ""high"".  I love being able to pop one of the ear buds out.

I had my reservations on how effective these would be in a cockpit as loud as the 737, but was amazed how quiet and effective they are.  Absolutely on par or better than the ANR of the clamp style DCs.

I did find the audio on the headset accentuated / amplified some of the background noises over the intercom of the B737.  I switched the ""Audio"" dip-switch under the battery from ""norm"" to ""low"" and I found the audio more comfortable and not as amplified. In this setting, the aircraft audio had a flattened more toned down sound to it, probably personal preference.

Overall, I really like these, they are super comfortable for long days, and long flights. I hope to get many years of use out of them. I regret not getting them sooner.",5,B07V395CNF,2022,the United States
R55XNCVRVM6ZY,There is NO Warranty,"I bought this product about one year ago. Which is still under warranty coverage for 4 more years. Suddenly right side ear started working intermittently and the problem got extended to the left side and also the mic. I checked the headset on 5 different B767 and B757s. The problem is that when I connected it to the aircraft, the headset not working at all and after a minute just the left ear and after that mic started working, and the right had just noise.
I called Bose warranty and did the troubleshooting steps recommended and they said there was a problem with your headset. But there is no Bose branch in Canada and just one company by the name of Brant Aero in Canada  may fix it.
Long story short, I sent it to the Brant Aero and still they can not find the problem and it is about one month that I call them and they play with my nerves.

In all aircraft the noise cancellation was excellent. I find the headset to be very comfortable and barely know I’m wearing it. I have the Bluetooth feature and use it regularly for clearance delivery at uncontrolled fields and closed towers. The noise canceling mic works so well that in the Debonair and the end of the runway ready to go I call for my IFR clearance. The controller read the clearance, I read it back and he stated “call when your ready to depart”. I stated that I am ready at runway 27. His statement was that “it’s awfully quiet” I stated that I was ready to go and he gave me my release for departure. I would recommend this headset to anyone not wanting to wear earmuffs! I have yet to replace the batteries it came with from the factory. Note that the Debonair and Bonanza have relatively quiet cabins for a single engine prop.

R1QK7LFTGB7FUN,Impressive!!!,"10/10 especially for sensitivity to over ear headphones. No pressure when wearing. I’ve had mine for almost 2 months now and use it every day in a 2021 Piper Archer III PA28. Noise canceling is comparitive to the Bose A20 maybe a little weaker but I have gotten used to it. Crystal clear CTAF and Tower calls. Bluetooth mix feature is noticeably smoother than the A20. Only complaint is it feels fragile but if you take care of it you shouldn’t have any issues. The Variable ANC is a nice feature so you can put your headset on before everyone else but still hear (when on low) and switch to high ANC when you start up the aircraft. I say this because it does take slightly longer to situate the headset compared to the over ear style.

R34MMJZY6FU09,"I fly the 737, Its a descent headset with a big BUT>>>","I logged 441 hours of flight time with this headset in a B737.  It is a lightweight headset and has a very light clamp pressure making it comfortable to wear.  It doesn't bother me pressure wise after flying for a typical 10 to 12 hour duty day at this point.  The case seems to be holding up for 3 legs a day and will probably last a year before a new one is required.  Sound quality is great and BT seems to work great but has had limited use since it is prohibited by the company and yeah I actually do follow the rules.  It goes through a pair of AA batteries for 2, 4 day trips (8 days of work).

Pros
Light, Bose sound quality and connectivity.

Cons,
Noise cancelling is ever present and REQUIRED.  The ear bud provides zero...zero...ZERO sound isolation on a 737 - 700, 800 or 900 aircraft without the vortex generators.  It is near useless if the batteries fail inflight.  The ear buds themselves are difficult to seat and while they have yet to fallout they will not consistently stay in the ear.  The headset also falls off your head if you do not have a crew cut and need verify anything on the aft overhead panel.  If you fly the 737, for example that would include: gear and flap secondary indications, cabin environmental controls, and of course the ever failing and resetting of Wi-Fi.  After all, nothing is more fun than have to adjust your headset on short final because it falls off if you have to look back and up.

Overall, Bose makes great headsets and great aviation headsets at that.  This one in particular unfortunately misses the mark.  I will be getting another Bose headset for work and I do not typically write reviews but this one needed to be written.  Buy a Bose...just don't buy this one.",3,B07V395CNF,2023,the United States
R2O2AUW4Q6KDCL,Not for 737,"I wanted to like them, I really did. I even bought 2 to see if the first pair I got was just a fluke.

The noise cancelling provided by the PF2 was severely lacking. Sure, it reduces the lower tones which is nice, but in the flight deck of a 737 its the high pitch wind noise I'm worried about (which the A20s handled extremely well). If you turn off the recirc fan at the gate because its loud and annoying, thats the type of sound the ProFlights DO NOT remove/cancel. In fact it's so bad at these frequencies, when I would pull the earbuds out to take a lav break, there was almost no audible change in the amount of wind noise, almost as if I had never put the headset on.  I don't want to listen to that for 5+ hours. Yes, I did turn the headset on and yes, I tried all the different ear bud sizes provided.

My $200 apple AirPods provide better noise cancellation than these.

Yes, the ear buds are uncomfortable, but i'm sure i'd get used to them after a month or so.

I couldn't hear myself transmitting on the radio. The intercom volume was fine, but it's annoying to think you're not going out when you suddenly can't hear yourself the moment you click the transmit button.

I'm disappointed they removed the individual volume options from the cable. That would've been nice to have.

Incredibly disappointed in these for a $1200 headset.

If you fly a narrow body, or a plane with a noisy flight deck, these are probably not for you. Wide body pilots might get some use out of them, but if you take the headset off above FL180 anyways, save your money. Buy a cheap Telex and some high fidelity ear plugs and call it a day.",3,B07V395CNF,2023,the United States
R1CT9O5LGIC81S,"When someone says something is great, you don't know what they're actually comparing it to.","I've been flying jets now for 17 years, first the CRJ 200/700/900, and now, the E175.  I've been flying Lightspeed headsets since 1998, so call me biased, or whatever.  I've seen a few ProFlight2 headsets come across my flight decks in the past couple of years, and every pilot/owner I've talked to had nothing but praise for them.  If they complained at all, it was about the head-pads that press into their head, but ""you get used to that.""  I've heard all the pros:  ""They're SO light."" ""ANR is *great*!""  ""I don't have ear-sweat any more.""  All good things, right?

So I bought one.

Pros: Super light! Under 5 ounces is not a joke.  Love that.  ANR, bass end of the spectrum is awesome!  Kills 95% of any low frequency rumbles you might normally have.

Cons: ANR...  Yes, it's true ANR, as in, there's a driver inside that actually attenuates frequencies that make it past the passive ear-dam silicone piece to your ear drum.  But, it's like listening to your airplane with a high-pass filter installed.  For you audio engineers, it's white noise, all the time, at a constant level, that you then must mix your intercom and ATC communications into.  So the total sound amplitude at your ear drum is never less than whatever level of white noise your airplane produces.  ALL of the mid to high end frequencies come through.  It's a constant hiss from windscreen noise, fans, and the like.  THAT part, for me, was exhausting, not to mention distracting.  It was worse on my first leg with the headset, where I used the medium-sized ear pieces it shipped with.  At the hotel, I exchanged those for the included large sized ear-inserts, and the noise level was slightly improved, but that constant hiss was still prevalent to me...  Again, I've had LightSpeed Zulu2 for the past 10 years, so I'm not used to anything but silence between my earcups.  Head-pad pressure does take a little getting used to, and I think I could give that a fair shake.

All that said, despite all the ""It's Great""s I heard about these, I've discovered that my friends don't know what great truly is.  For a bunch of cash less than these, and the A20's, you can have a quieter experience for up to 9 hours a day (legally, of course!), in a sufficiently comfortable, premium headset -- If you just buy the LightSpeed Zulu 3 headset instead.  I was looking into Bose after my Zulu 2 was deemed ""the spare"" headset, as after ten years of professional, daily use, it needs some refurbishment.  I thought I'd try something new on the recommendation of other people who've apparently never tried anything but Bose.  But I'll be returning this ProFlight2 and have already ordered my replacement Zulu 3. It's built better too, so maybe that one might last the rest of my career.  There's nothing wrong with the ProFlight2 from Bose, but for the money, I expected more.  Quiet is first, before comfort, and with the Zulu3, I get both, and both are comparably better than what I found with this Bose ProFlight 2.  The ONLY place the ProFlight 2 shines for me is its lack of weight.  Everything else relating to quality and value, Bluetooth music included, was simply average.  Not one aspect is bad -- it's Bose after all.  But nothing was truly great.  I've had this hunch for over 20 years now, and today, it's confirmed:  If you want great...  Go with LightSpeed.",2,B07V395CNF,2022,the United States

I was able to purchase the A30 on site at IAH. Was hoping I could just give them back and replace with these new ones. I was buying these regardless of refund or not due to the pain induced.  I received a # and talked to a Bose rep. They said it was only 30 day returns and that I’m stuck with these overpriced garbage headsets.. she said they would fix for free and that I could sell them!

R2QZ9DOW16IXZL,Bad form factor,"Having used the uFlyMic for a compact solution with good noise canceling I found these to be a let down. For me personally they are comfortable and noise cancellation is pretty good given there is no ear cover. However if you're doing multiple legs it seems like the headset is lacking in how delicate it seems and how onerous it is to put it away. Like you should probably practice putting it away at least twice before bringing it to the line.

The thing that really bothers me is that neither side twists or folds to allow the mic assembly to lay flat unless you unplug it(the adapter does not look like it is designed to do that regularly). Because the mic CAN'T lay flat the case needs to be bulky. So you have a case double the height of the regular Bose headset case like the QC25/35 and way wider across. It needs to be that big to protect the mic assembly that would otherwise be crushed at the point where the wire attaches if compressed. So it's hard to put away, slightly difficult to untangle and plug in and it isn't compact when put away. Unless I can find a way to store it safely in a smaller volume I'll likely return it. If you're only expecting to fly one leg and just have all day to mess around with this bs then maybe it's right for you because it is very light, and for me at least the ear piece material was pretty nice(feel like some kind of silicon gel).

For me a headset needs to be good at being a headset but ALSO pack away compactly or at least dawn or put away quickly and easily. I didn't see anyone else mention this so there you go. Bose if you read this, make your aviation headsets fold to lay flat and compact.",2,B07V395CNF,2022,the United States

RCPZS655HCN3C,Needs improvments,"Ive owed at least seven aviation headsets. My hopes were high for this one but I’m disappointed.
Pros:
1. It’s light weight and doesnt mess up the hair to much.

Cons:
1. On extended flights over 3-4 hours long the ear buds will get uncomfortable and ache a bit. They dont hurt as much as the clarity aloft but they do get uncomfortable in your ears during long flights.

2. After 10 months my boom mic bent where the boom meets the plastic head band and the mic boom dangled. I had to physically hold the mic up to my mouth each time I spoke. Bose made me send the broken boom in to be fixed under warranty and shipped it back. This left me without a headset for a few weeks. I tried to get them to ship a replacement part and allow me to return the defective part once the replacement arrived but they wouldn't allow it. I had to send my defective boom in for repair and wait for it’s return.

3. For such a lightweight headset, the carrying case is very large and takes up a lot of room. If the headset isn't packed properly in the case the mic boom will get destroyed and will dangle, lose rigidity.

4. The hot mic intercom vs atc transmissions volume cannot be adjusted.  This is annoying! Often either ATC or intercom will be way to loud while the other is to low. In the GIV’s I fly, I’ll have to listen yo the other pilot’s extremely loud over the intercoms and can’t hear ATC over the loud intercom transmissions.",2,B07V395CNF,2022,the United States
R3MWHQJRXL1JZN,"Overall, a good purchase for the 757/767","The noise cancellation works well, but the high noisee gives a side tone that's almost as loud s the noise it's cancelling. Medium seems to work better on the 757/767. The tap through function is nifty, but sometimes requires me to tap it multiple times to get it to work. My biggest complaint is that the ear pieces just don't seem to fit me well. I've jumped between medium and large (small doesn't work at all for me) and still, I find myself having to push them deeper into my ear every 10-15 minutes or so. The Bluetooth and other functions are fine, and it's light enough to wear comfortably for a whole transcon.

RY8YFGKPTFOTS,Noise canceling is not up to par but still suggest it over any headset,Noise canceling isn't up to par even with the lights of airport pros. There's a cheaper ufq lites 2 put there that offer everything the bose offer but the noise canceling is actually better by a lot. Still suggest buying the bos proflight 2. The maim reason is that it doesn't get in the way of wearing sunglasses or glasses if you wear glasses to fly. With that said the microphone audio is also better on the bose and over being so lightweight you can't go wrong. But don't buy these and expect to get noise canceling performance like the a20 or other cheaper headsets with noise canceling.

R62L3CMPFRGO,Great headset,Totally worth the money. Works great in the Airbus 320 but could probably use it in a Cessna. Only thing I would change is the part that goes over the top of the head. There’s got to be a way to support the mic that isn’t so big.,5,B07V395CNF,2021,the United States
RHU5PGP1U6F5P,Best headset I have ever owned.,"I got this as a gift to myself when I got hired on with Piedmont airlines flying the Embraer 145. It’s the perfect headset for the job as it’s light and doesn’t squeeze you head like the big headsets do.
I also use it in the 172 for flight instruction and it works great there also with the noise canceling.
I can’t think of anything that I don’t like about it.
I highly recommend this headset for the career pilot. You won’t be sorry!!",5,B07V395CNF,2020,the United States

I was not satisfied with the comfort of the in-ear. They do supply 3 different size eat pieces, and I did try them. The headband also was rather tight for only holding the mic in place.

Noise cancellation is excellent as expected from Bose, almost too good. Ear buds are comfortable but make it difficult to pop the headset on/off. The headband squeezes the sides of your head vs compressing ear pads against your ears like traditional headsets. This gave me a 2 day headache after 1st 3day trip. Very “dainty” device that I do not believe will hold up to the rigors of airline life. I’ve flown with a lot of guys that like it which is why I gave it a try while DC Pro’s are being repaired.

The actual bud that goes in your ear is extremely uncomfortable for more than an hour or so at a time. If your flying longer hauls than 1 hour I would try them out first before you spend a thousand dollars on them. I tried all three sizes and they all are uncomfortable. Bose has a specific proprietary bud cover that has a hard plastic core which is the reason for the uncomfortable feel. If you try other silicon tips they don't fit properly and end up falling out. Other than that the sound technology is spot on. Very quiet. My recommendation is try this set and the over ear A20s and go from there. Happy flying!",1,B07V395CNF,2020,the United States

The only negative is that I use these to try and block out the sound of my baby in the night while sleeping and his white noise machine is sometimes too much for the headphone's noise cancelling circuit if it is turned up too loud. It tends give a short sharp static sound, similar to the sound of plugging in a guitar to an amp while still turned on, that wakes me up every 15 minutes or so. I then just about get back to sleep and it happens again. I would have thought a white noise machine would be no problem for noise cancelling headphones of this price???",4,B098FKXT8L,2023,Australia

R22NBMXSQU9005,Truely Fantastic Headphones,"I did quite a lot of research on Active Noise Cancelling headphones before making a purchase. I watched endless youtube reviews and read several articles on these QC 45's and the likes of the Sony XM4 and XM5, Bose 700 and the brand new Bose QC Ultra.

These headphones are amazing. I've never had a decent pair before, prior to buying these I've been using a 10 year old battered set of over ear AKG's and a pair 1st gen Samsung buds. These QC 45's smash both out of the park.

Pairing and setup is a walk in the park. Just download the Bose Music App prior to delivery and you're all set. Buttons are minimal, work well and easy to locate.

They feel premium, the materials and comfortability are just premium. They're lightweight and you can barely notice you're wearing them, there's minimal clamping force on the ears which makes the ANC even more impressive.

Sound quality is phenomenal, but for me, only when you alter the EQ via the app. The bass straight out of the box is a lacking but once it's raised up to around +8 and the treble lowered to -2 it's a really, really nice sound. I've tried various types of music as well as audiobooks, all great.

The noise cancelling is incredible with music. Just incredible. Mind blowing really. But that's probably because as I said I've never owned a premium ANC set of headphones. But wow. Little less impressive with an audiobook but that's to be expected.

I chose these over the others solely because from all the reviews I read and watched, these were the most well rounded and well balanced.
According to some reviews the ANC on the 700's is better, but they're less comfortable (higher clamping force).
The sound quality on the XM4/XM5 is apparently better but the XM4's are creaky on the hinges and the XM5'S don't fold. Plus both are so say terrible on call quality.
And the Bose QC Ultras don't have much better anything versus the QC 45's and they're over £200 more.

So if you want a lightweight, comfortable, quality sounding pair of ANC headphones that have decent call quality and a really good sturdy travel case. Buy these.",5,B098FKXT8L,2023,the United Kingdom
RO55LQLOGZFRU,"Good Blend of Comfort, Clarity, and Brand!","I recently snagged the Bose QC 45 headphones during a fantastic deal on BB Amazon India, and let me tell you, it's been an absolute steal! Bose, a name synonymous with quality, lives up to its reputation with this gem of a product.

Sound Quality:
The audio quality is undoubtedly excellent, though seasoned audiophiles might find it impressive rather than mind-blowing. The sound is bright and crystal clear, with bass that's perfectly audible without being overbearing. If ear-thumping bass isn't your thing, these headphones strike an ideal balance. Perhaps, you’re looking for ear thumping bass then just go with Sony’s XM line.

Comfort is King:
In the realm of headphones, comfort is paramount, and the QC 45s take the crown (after Sennheiser PXC 550 ii). They're a breeze to wear, even for extended periods. What's more, they're refreshingly straightforward, opting for reliable physical buttons instead of finicky touch-sensitive controls that can sometimes lead to accidental activations.

Top-Tier Noise Cancellation:
When it comes to noise cancellation, these headphones shine. They excel at creating an immersive audio experience, though I must admit the mic quality leaves a bit to be desired. While not subpar by any means, there's room for improvement. In comparison, it outpaces Sony's XM4 but falls slightly behind Sennheiser's PXC550ii and Momentum 4.

Impressive Battery Life:
The battery life, while not mind-blowing, is certainly commendable. It holds its own alongside Sony's offerings, providing an average user with a solid week of usage on a single charge. Power users can expect a respectable 2-3 days. The added convenience of a quick toggle button for On/Off functionality is a thoughtful touch.

Durable Design:
The build quality is robust, with no noticeable weak links. While earpads may need replacement after a year or two, this is par for the course with most headphones. The advantage of a renowned brand like Bose is that finding replacements online is a breeze.

Travel-Friendly:
The included carry case, though not hard shell, is both stylish and practical. It makes for hassle-free portability, making it an ideal companion for your journeys.

Aesthetically Pleasing:
The design strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and elegance. It's not overly bulky or flashy, offering a low profile when worn. This, in my opinion, sets it apart from competitors like the XM5, Momentum 4, and AirMax.

In conclusion, the Bose QC 45 headphones deliver an unparalleled blend of comfort, clarity, and convenience. While there are other strong contenders in the market, this offering's seamless marriage of quality and reputation makes it a standout choice. For me, it's become the go-to, despite my personal fondness for the Momentum 4. The Bose QC 45s come highly recommended for anyone seeking a superior audio experience, comfortable over ears and has low profile with world class branding!

Alternatives:
Momentum 4 - if sound quality is the only major priority. Perhaps it’s amazing with battery, features, mic, built quality as well. Only downside I find is it’s bulky and design.
Sony XM4 - if you want bass and features.
AirMax - If you have apple ecosystem and excess money and most importantly strong neck (they’re heavy).
Marshall Momentum 2 - If you want to stand out of the crowd, reputable brand, killer looks, enjoyable sound signature (unique), amazing battery and similar price range.
Major downside is with its mic. Else that was my pick!

It totally depends on your needs. Prioritise them and you’ll end up with right cans for you!

The big kicker for me is I like having physical buttons to feel for and push which these have instead of just touching headphones that make random changes depending how many times/long you touch it like the 700s. Having the physical buttons there is something I still like having. Touch control always  accidentally gets pushed when laying down with them and it screws with the sound.

R2H2ZYBOHRMLMR,"attractive, and worth it for noise cancelling","I bought these based on a fair amount of research and because of the recommendation of a friend who also let me try them out.
I need active noise cancellation (ANC) to deal with city noises heard indoors when I want to concentrate, and also to share space quietly with others.  I also use over-ear phones outside in winter for my energetic-walking music while keeping my ears warm when it's very cold, which earbuds can't do. I find these very comfortable for hours of use, and really effective for ANC.  For public transit and walking where I need to be conscious of surroundings for safety purposes, the ""aware"" function does let in a lot of environmental sound but still keeps the music clear.
There are more controls than I probably will regularly use but the basic ones are not too hard to learn and I really like that they are buttons {instead of  touch-sensitive, like most earbuds, which are often annoyingly triggered when I wear a hat or hood that rubs on them).
I don't need crazy long battery life (it is already pretty good) so these are consistent with my uses.
The slim profile can easily be worn under a hood in winter or when it's raining and I really like the look compared to my bulky old phones.
The grey colour is also a good neutral option as it looks good on me and helps distinguish my phones from everyone else's black ones.
The case is strong and well-made, which is important for travel.",5,B0B7KCN31G,2023,Canada

R1BHZLJPHDMYJN,Great headphones just beaten by the Sony XM4,"If you're considering buying the Bose QC45, you're probably also considering the Sony 1000XM4 headphones too. They're both priced about the same currently and are both getting great reviews.
Yet I was torn between the two so I decided to buy both and keep the one I liked the most. At least that was the plan.

The Sony XM4s have been a runaway success only recently replaced by the XM5 which are £100 more, so I left these out as they were just a bit more then I wanted to spen.

Here's what I liked and disliked about them both.

Build quality and comfort
The Bose QC45 feel light in the hand and well made. However I did not like the exposed screws. The Sony XM4s are better sealed at the joints and feel better well built in the hand. The Sony is a fraction heavier but there's nothing in it between the two.
The ear pads are better on the Sony. They just feel more cushioned than the Bose. The Bose feel cheaper. I also noticed that the headband on the Sony is slightly more comfortable. I found the Bose headband would dig in to the top of my head slightly. You notice you're wearing them after a while.
The Sony cups feel they have more space in them for your ears. I felt my ears were touching the inside of the cups on the Bose.

Noise cancelling/transparacy mode
I like the way you can switch the Bose between transparent and noise cancelling. It's just a single press of the button on the left cup. Simple. Both modes work brilliatly. I've used the transparency mode while walking so I can still hear some traffic, and the NC mode in my local noisy coffee shop. Both modes work very well.
The call quality is excellent. The other person on the call could hear me very well during a walk outside on a rather windy day. No issues with calls.

Controls
The Bose has physical buttons for the volume controls and to pause play. The Sony has touch sensitive controls which are getting some bad reviews online. This is totally wrong in my opinion. The touch controls work very well on the Sony. I found with the Bose that when I wanted to adjust the volume, I had to place several fingures on the right cup before pressing down on the volume with my index finger. I found that otherwise the cup would slightly move from my ear which became anoying having to reposition it again for comfort. The Sony is just a one finger swipe and very easy to do without disturbing the cup position.
The Bose buttons don't feel that high quality. They don't have that satisfiying click or feel.
You get a nice satisfying confirmation sound when toggling the on/off button, again a phyical switch that does feel it will break at some point. You get a voice confirmation that you are connected and the battery power remaining. The Bose has a very old computer generated voice which is terrible. The Sony voice is much more modern and clear making the Sony feel more up to date.
The Sony has a press and hold button to power on/off. This also gives you a confimation that your Bluetooth has connected.

Sound
So the important stuff. I've played several tracks over and over on both headphones switching between the two and repeating the track.
There are some differencs and it is all subjective.
I found the Bose was clearer in the midrange and higher tones. I also felt there was a little more clarity in the words of the song then in the Sony.
But the Sony came across more powerful lower down with base. You just feel the Sony has more capacity and power. The music sounds stronger.
The Bose is very good but just lacks the real strong base of a track.

App
I tried both with no EQ straight out of the box. When I adjusted the EQ on both, I got even stronger sound from both. The Sony still feels more punchy. The Bose is very good for podcasts, super clear and great noise cancelling.
The EQ on the Bose is very simple with very little adjustments. The Sony is more comprehensive.
The Sony has a much better App with more ajustments. It can even learn your regular locations and adjust the sound and NC accordingly. The Bose does none of this.
The Sony has a great feature that pauses the music if you simply start to talk to someone. It also switches to transparent mode so you can hear them. Great when ordering a coffee! The Bose doesn't do this.
The Sony pauses the music if you lift the headphones off your head, resumes play when you place them back on. The Bose doesn't do this.
You can cover the right cup with your hand on the Sony to temparaliy switch to transparancy mode to listen to someone speak. The Bose doesn't do this.

Conclusion
Overall, both headpones are brilliant in their own way and in isolation.
I just feel I keep leaning over to the Sony for some reason. They just feel better quality, sound stronger and have better controls and features. They just feel more expensive.
I feel you're paying for the Bose branding and would truly price the Bose QC45 between £150-£200 max. The Sony on the other hand feel a bargain at £240 currently.
Both have a nice small case yet the Sony case seems more thought out with better internals. The Sony case has a canvas feel, the Bose a hard shell feel. Both very protable in your bag.
One final thought which has been overlooked by online reviewers. The Bose branding on the side of the cups stands out. This made me feel concious of wearing them while walking in the street letting others know I have a pair of expensive headphones on. The Sony are much more discreet and can be mistaken at a distance for their cheaper £50 headphones. I just felt more relaxed wearing the Sony out in public.
Yet it felt the opposite while sitting in a coffee shop wearing the Bose. I felt good wearing a quality product and brand everyone knows. It's a small thing but I noticed how it made me feel.

I'm reluctant to return the Bose QC45s but between the two, I feel the Sony XM4s are just better.",5,B098FKXT8L,2023,the United Kingdom

R19UNDXQBV7AS7,"Great sound, comfort, and noise canceling","Really enjoying these headphones so far. Owned for about 6 months now, I think. They are quick/ efficient at connecting to my phone's Bluetooth, which is nice. Never had an issue with that. (Bose's 'earbuds' on the other hand, which I also own and have replaced a couple times thru warranty for various reasons... I've had consistent issues with them connecting via Bluetooth to my phone.)

These headphones have good enough sound quality for me. A decently balanced sound.

The clamping pressure is pretty good, fairly light. I can wear them for long periods of time without too much issue, but maybe it's not the most comfortable on the crown of my head after wearing a while. Still, a ton more comfortable than my old GSP500 Sennheiser/Epos headphones were; and much better binaural/spacial audio than them, too. (I can hear directionality of sounds in video games again, whereas that was mostly lost with my Sennheiser/Epos GSP500 open ear ones.)

I like the carrying case for these, too. Compact, somewhat hard, zipper-up. The headphones collapse and fold inward a bit to fit in the case. I like it! You may not notice at first or second glance, but there is a small visual diagram in the carrying case showing you how to find them to make them fit. Very helpful!",5,B098FKXT8L,2023,Canada
R24JLAA8TOZ878,My top 3 reasons for picking QC45s,"I realize the QC45s have some slight shortcomings in certain areas but their strengths are why I chose them. I have watched so many reviews on the top N/C headphones it irritates my wife, but here is what you can learn from my OCD (hopefully). First the competition and why I didn't select these.
Airpod Max - Cost, weight and the stupid, stupid, stupid case.
Sony XM4/XM5 - Bulky and didn't want gesture controls (just my preference).
Bose NC700 - Didn't like the style and band adjustment, didn't fold up small enough and gesture control.
There are other headphones in the consumer space but these are the big players and my top 3 reasons for picking QC45s were,
1. Space, these fold up into a small case, big, big plus. My main use will be for travel and I wanted the smallest footprint for my carryon.
2. Noise cancelling, I tried and compared these to Sony and the NC700 at an electronic shop in an airport and I thought these were the best. This was before the XM5s, from reviews they might have a slight advantage but not significant.
3. Comfort, all the reviews said the weight, clamping force, cabin pressure, cavity size and breathability were the best of any of the N/C top picks. Smart move by Bose to have another iteration of the QC35s, the comfort is unrivaled.
I will use these mostly for travel, I had QC15s I bought for a wedding anniversary for my wife and I when we were flying for a cruise. They served us well, even bought a Bluetooth adapter for them, still working great and gave them to a family couple. That was 10 years ago, so another anniversary seemed like a reasonable purchase. The other players have features that surpass the QC45s, better sound, more bass, more adjustments but none of these were that important to me. For me comfort was very high on the list and I just like physical buttons and the sound is very good so no complaints there.

Update
Comfort - After almost 1 month I can confirm the comfort of these headphones. My wife's sleep schedule is different than mine so I have been using these connected to our Apple TV while she is sleeping. 2 or more hours with no fatigue, pain or any discomfort at all. As I stated in my original review, comfort was probably my top priority and I am so happy with them.

Noise Cancelling - I give the noise cancelling 5 out of 5, absolutely amazing and no hissing or cabin pressure. Adjustable NC just isn't that important to me, I just want it on or off. In this case it would be ambient, it would be nice to have the option to just turn NC off. Hoping a firmware will be coming to give that option but not a big deal.

Sound - EQ'd the sound in the app and I am very happy with how they sound. I'm not a bass junkie or a audiophile but I like upper scale speakers (2 Sonos 5s in my living room for example) and these headphones do not disappoint.

Battery - I haven't measured the actual time but the claimed 24 hours seems pretty close and that is more than adequate.

2nd Update

My adult daughter flew home for Christmas and she had replaced her Bose QC 25s that had stopped working with the Sony XM4s. So I got to spend some time with the XM4s, played with the app, listened to music, tried the noise cancelling and wore them for a while to test the comfort. I was very impressed, not surprising given the reputation of the XM4s but my personal opinion is the sound was very comparable to my Bose QC45s. I didn’t A/B switch the headphones but I have been listening to the QC45s for a couple of months now so that gave a good reference point. Noise cancelling of the XM4s was excellent, I still think the Bose have the edge but only a very slight advantage, it was cool to have the ability to turn off NC and get better battery life and still wish the Bose had this feature (still holding out hope a firmware will come to give this) but it isn’t a big disappointment for me. The comfort was again excellent, the ear cushions were super supple and gave a great seal. The Sony app had a lot more options than the Bose, if your an app nerd you could geek out on it, if your not it could seem complicated, for me I wouldn’t spend time in it so it’s not a significant advantage but that’s me. As I said in my original review adjustable NC isn’t something I would use so that feature isn’t for me but the Sony’s have it if you would like it.

Summary of the XM4s from my perspective is they are comparable to the Bose in many ways, comfort, sound, noise cancelling, case size and better in some aspects like the app and the ability to turn NC off. It comes down to personal preferences and I like physical buttons but wow if you like the features of the Sony they are a top of the line headphones and you would love them. I still would choose the Bose but it was fun playing with the Sony XM4s.

3rd Update
There were some references to wind noise with the QC45s in comments and reviews because the 45s don't have the ability to turn off NC (if I remember correctly). I was letting the dog out the other day and had my QC45s on and there was a mild wind. Yes you do get wind noise, so if you are going to use headphones outside consider this. I don't see this being an issue for me, guess only when I let the dog out, yeah first world problem. I keep mentioning the firmware update that could fix this (and added battery when not needed) with some hopes that a Bose rep will take notice (might have a better chance of winning the lottery) but for now this is a narrow circumstantial issue. For me it's the comfort that trumps the advantages that the competition has over the QC45s.",5,B098FH5P3C,2022,the United States
R1N21MPON2O2XE,Treated myself with the best gift  this year,"I was looking to buy QC headphones for a long time. Finally took courage to try my hands on QC45 and XM5. Both had offers running and XM5 had more discount over QC45. I went to near by croma store to compare both units.

Noise cancellation:
Croma had a very big closed indoor space with many people around during festival time, lots of devices playing in the background. Good environment to check the noise cancellation. I liked QC45 among the two. Off/On the NC we can clearly make out the difference.

Comfort:
Easy, relaxed, no irritation on ears, cups sat nicely over my ears with QC45. Cups are made of synthetic though it didn't make a diff for me.  XM5 are big pushy on the ears and my ears touched the inside sound drivers literally.

Ergonomics:
You can't go wrong the QC45 cup controls. Works 100% everytime. Thanks to the old gen physical buttons. Otherside xm5 needs time to get used to touch controls. Need trial and error attempts before you master the controls.

Sound:
QC45 audio quality sounds realistic.  XM5 comes with more punch and amplified base which I felt heavy on my ears.

App:
Bose app is simple and clear. No nonsense. First time Setup till playback is all guided via app. I have another Sony model XB910N and had experience using their app. They provide 360 audio which is not practical enough. You need to buy those special tracks from other listed apps to experience 360 audio. Sony plays their features to create stickiness for customers. Wat you see on their products is not always yours. You need to keep spending money.

Color and looks:
It's always subjective. QC45 smoke white color is a gold standard. Vintage piece to own.

Marketing strategy:
Sony and Bose are quite opposite in marketing strategy. Sony tends to attract young audiences by sharing the tech used in their products like "" 8 array mic setup to get optimal noise cancellation experience"". Even Bose does the same but they won't advertise their intellectual property information in public for any of their products. That differentiates how well the products reach to new age audience.  You will rarely find discounts for Bose products. Sony sales in the last couple of years is heavily into discounts and festive offers.

Alternatives:
Bose 700 has all the bells and whistles to compete with XM5 for an extra money. But QC45 is classic. End of the day we are buying these headphones for the Audio experience and not for complex smart features on it.

I suggest to try the models you like before making purchase decision. Don't go by discounts and brand names.  I also followed the reviews on www.rtings.com before making this choice.

Thanks for reading through my purchase experience. Happy shopping and enjoy ",5,B098FH5P3C,2023,India
R2C1U77J0WHC5S,"Excellent, excellent headphones 5 stars","I actually bought 4 pairs of over ear headphones for real world comparisons and these Bose q45’s came out on top. I tested the Bose against Beats Studio 3’s and Sony’s xm4’ and Sennheiser momentum 3’s. The Bose were crystal clear an any volume, they were the most comfortable as well. The Bluetooth is excellent, it has a long range and doesn’t cut out. Excellent battery life and easy to operate, I love these headphones. Sony’s we’re loose fitting and would fall off if you bent over too much. The Beats were crushing my head they were so tight and they weren’t “clear”, sound was a little muddled. The Sennheiser momentum 3’s would cut out just by turning my head they were big and loose fitting, a huge disappointment from Sennheiser. The anc on the Bose is phenomenal and I can wear them all day without experiencing listening fatigue. Great headphones!!!",5,B0B7KCP6SL,2022,Canada
R1SQYQJYWZIJBQ,Totally happy with this headset,"Although I've had other bluetooth headsets, this is my first noise cancelling set. As you'd expect from Bose, they sound amazing and are comfortable.

I like that they will connect to my PC and phone at the same time.",5,B0B7KCP6SL,2023,Canada
RH0FU25DDYDXK,All-round good noise-cancelling headset,"I hesitated to place the order even with the Prime day discount.  This headset turns out to be better than I expected.  This is my second headset after the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B.

I use it primarily indoors studying, and sometimes on public transit, and it does the job significantly reducing most ambient noise even without music on (excellent for studying).  About 8 hours listening, volume not very loud, brings my battery from full to about 60-70%)

The earpads are comfortable in prolonged use (2-3 hours straight each time).  The power, volume, and start/stop buttons are simple.  I hardly use the app except to check battery levels.  The ""quiet/aware"" mode is somewhat redundant, as I prefer to take off the headset if I need to interact.

The weakness is that even ""quiet"" mode is noisy from wind noise.  The microphone or algorithm cannot cancel the wind noise, so it's largely picked up and relayed regardless of which mode you're on.  Other than that, I'm very happy with this handset.  It's simple to use, and nicely made, while not looking pretentious with a Bose label.  I'm glad I chose this over its stylish sibling.",5,B098FKXT8L,2022,Canada

They're better than earbuds and you don't have to spend your whole savings on headphones. I chose Bose cuz they were cheaper than Sony (when I bought them 2 years ago). Sound quality is nice, comfortable, and noise cancelation works pretty well. I'll be on a busy bus or a plane and the headphones do a good job in blocking outside sounds.

R1JLS84GFLXEBK,A+ on all expectations,"My Bose QuietComfort 45 Wireless Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones arrived a bit later than promised. Additionally, I bought them as new, but noticed the box had been opened, the instructions loose and a wrapper for the optional cords had been ripped off. I was definitely of the mind to return them and complain. However I inspected them for tell-tale signs of use, they appeared mint and figured I would at least try them out.

I connected them via bluetooth to my android phone, LG OLED TV, and my computer. All three sounded fantastic. When the bass kicked in during a movie it was outstanding. Bluetooth word/mouth sync on some shows was off but not on the majority of what I viewed. I did not experience noise issues, signal loss or any other negatives mentioned in other reviews. And they are unbelievably comfortable for extended periods of time. Battery life is very good. I've used them for 8 hours at a stretch and still had quite a bit of juice.

So I decided to keep them despite the initial open box disappointment. They were not advertised by Amazon as refurbished and definitely not offered at the refurbished price. But I know quality when I hear it. My other headphones are Grado's and they are a good comparison indicator (although open ear).

The ability to wander around and filter out noisy neighbors with these is worth the price alone. That I can go jogging, watch movies or sit around in perfect quiet comfort and work the New York Times puzzles and games is priceless.",5,B098FKXT8L,2024,the United States

After some time of owning the 2000-QC1's I was offered an upgrade-trade-in by a Bose retailer back in 2003 to QC2's. Sadly however, my QC2's  just 3 days ago the right speaker died - after 20 years of  Bose QC2 audio bliss - I have had many hours of movies, gaming and music on the QC2's - 20 years of matchless reliability. Last Monday morning I ordered the QC45's, and then by Monday evening the left QC2 speaker died. I received my new QC45's Tuesday evening and the sound is even better than ever. I needed to respect the learning curve on theQC45 different buttons. I have only owned these new QC45's for just a day so far. Will I get 20 years out of these new QC45 headphones like I did with the QC2's?

R346GFNTXP4UM0,"Bose qc 45 triple black, hard case.","OK, I've read a lot of reviews on here and let's put a few things straight.
Me as background, 53 year old guy, using headphones for over 40 years, currently own xm4 and xm5 headphones and xm3 earbuds.
CONNECTIVITY.
Linked instantly to my Samsung a22 5g phone and sonru bluetooth 5.2 transmitter (for watching TV) no lip sync problems at all, walked all around my flat with no drop outs at all. 10/10
ANC.
This is superb, it's certainly as good as my wh xm4's if not slightly better because you have almost zero white noise. I am very surprised by this. ""aware mode"" is also very good. 9/10
SOUND.
Out of the box these are treble heavy, not good at all. But once you connect to the ""bose music"" app you can adjust the eq (please see pictures), once you reduce the treble to - 6 and add +2 to the bass these sound fantastic. I would put them on a par with the xm4 easily. Very detailed, warm bass and the mids are all there. I'm using Spotify highest quality setting and aac codec. (I run my Sony headphones on aac codec as this sounds great with no drop outs), so don't worry about ldac and aptx etc, there are NO lip sync issues at all. 9/10
BOSE MUSIC APP.
This is simple and basic compared to sony, but it is just exactly what you need, no silly gimmicky functions, just straight forward. Once you adjust your eq you can save these settings so when you reconnect your headphones they are ready to go. I have tried this personally and it works. So I give the app 9/10 purely because it's simple and does what you need it to do.
PHONE CALLS.
Sorry! I use headphones for music.
BUTTONS.
These are responsive and work very well, I'm used to sensor pads (swipe gestures) on my Sony""s but these can be awkward sometimes so I actually enjoy having buttons again. 9/10.
CONCLUSION.
I paid £209 new for these and I don't regret this at all. £319 rrp! I would feel uncomfortable with that price.
Oooh! Nearly forgot.....
COMFORT.
Very comfortable as good as my wh xm4's and with the added bonus that these don't creak at all, no hinge clicking etc. Worn for 3 hours as we speak and I hardly know I'm wearing them, no hot ears, 9/10.
Hope this helps you people make an informed decision.
I'm selling my xm5 now as these and my xm4's are my goto headphones now.....
UPDATE.
After about 10 hours plus of listening to my Spotify playlists, I can say that the qc 45 are actually better than my Sony xm4's and xm5's! I'm hearing instruments and backing vocals that I never knew songs had! I'm seriously impressed
Been for a walk outside and traffic noise is literally just gone! Even my xm5s let the tyre noise through, but listening at 50%volume it's just the music.
So 10/10..",5,B098FKXT8L,2023,the United Kingdom
R3MH0CS2Z975UL,Great Noise Cancellation,"I have long used the Bose Quiet Comfort 20 on-ear noise-cancelling earbuds, and they are great. I find them to become uncomfortable after a couple of hours, and a work colleague recommended his Bose over-the-ear headphones.
The noise cancellation is outstanding - I can listen to and enjoy music at very low levels because background noises are so well suppressed. I am in a pretty quiet environment at work, but I have also used them in my home office next to our laundry room, and they handle the washer and dryer just as well as background office noise. The silence sounds slightly artificial - like being in 'the uncanny valley' of CGI, but I have found that with all the noise-cancellation products I have tried.
The bluetooth setup was easy; they pair to my iPod quickly and I like that I don't feel 'tethered to my device' when moving in my cubicle the way I did with the (wired) QC-20s. They are comfortable, and I can wear them for several hours without complaint.
I have seen reviews that objected that there is no 'fine control' of the level of noise suppression. I find I don't use the ""aware"" (reduced or no noise cancellation) mode - I have the noise cancellation on whenever I am using the headphones: if I need to talk to someone I just take them off. If that's an issue for you, you should be aware of it, but I can't see much value in graduated noise control.
The only thing I don't like is that it would be nice to be able to charge them while in use, but the USB-C charging cord is about six inches long (maybe eight) - so you can charge, or listen, but not both, and there's no charger included.",5,B098FKXT8L,2022,Canada

In my opinion I feel like the a30 fine tuned the great things about the a20.

This being said though from getting to fly an a20 on occasion and not as a primary headset. My headset before was a Denali d90 from flightcom. I love that headset, super comfortable, ok ANR. I say that to say, going from the d90 to the a30 made the d90 feel like a clamp with a David Clark being a vice on that scale lol. The ANR on the a30 is so good, I had to relearn all the engine noise nuances. Bluetooth is seamless and sounds amazing phone and music.

All this being said, the price is absolutely ridiculous, there is no amount of explanation you could give me that would make me believe these things in their current state are worth over $1,300. With the exception that it’s purely price gouging thanks Bose’s near monopoly on the product and little to no comparable competition.",3,B0BVBVPSX6,2024,the United States
R1NKBQ1NO84A5Y,A20 vs A30,"I am a 28 plus years 737 pilot and have owned the A20s for over 10 years
I recently purchased the A30s and just completed a 3 day trip wearing them
I am returning the A30s and continuing operations utilizing my A20s
I would purchase A20s over 30s if the price was the same and it’s not
In my opinion the A20 has better noise reduction ( passive, I think)
The thing I disliked on the A30s the most is a clam shell, low frequency thumping sound while taxing.
The A20s do this also but not 25% of of the A30s
The A30s have a double tap ANR off/on feature on each ear piece( good idea) but if I adjust headset or bump it accidentally it turns ANR off
I wouldn’t say “ don’t buy the A30s” but I would say buy the A20s over them
Some may disagree but I haven’t found anyone else that has experience with both
I’m a Bose fan and love my A20s",3,B0BVBVPSX6,2024,the United States
R2XDIZJPDXCQ0B,Not Bose known quality,"Just like a good movie, the sequel is rarely better than the first. Unfortunately in my opinion that was the case with these headphones. I wear prescription glasses and sunglasses while I fly. I operate the Boeing 737 NG and MAX aircraft as well as General aviation aircraft. I purchased these headsets to supersede my Bose A20 headsets. I took both pairs of headsets with me flying, to conduct a realtime comparison in flight. I first tried the A30 headsets, the first thing I noticed was the audio sounded ""tinny"" as if I was talking in a soup can. ""tv audio vs a sound bar"" The headphones felt cheap and ""plasticky."" The headphone audio cord, while thinner and lighter, felt as if it would tear easily if it became entangled. The headphones have a noticeably lighter clamping pressure which was welcomed. Unfortunately as a prescription glasses wearer the headphones would rotate off my ear where the temple arms pass under the pad. This lead to distortion in the noise canceling, and a major aural distraction. The headphone would also move off my ear when I would make facial expressions and turn my head. After changing back to the A20 headset mid flight, all of these issues were resolved. If you were to take a pilot not familiar with Bose aviation headsets and give them both pairs, they would undoubtedly state the newer and improved headsets were the A20. My conclusion of the Bose A30 headset is they are not worth the price point set by Bose.  They feel cheaply made and did not meet my expectations of Bose in Fit, audio quality, and overall quality. Bose has released a subpar product and is banking on their legacy to sell units. The price point of this unit needs to be significantly lower as it does not meet my Bose quality expectations. The A20 while having slightly stronger clamping force and slightly less effective noise cancelling ""I could not tell the difference.""  is a much better product overall.",2,B0BVBVPSX6,2023,the United States
R2CHQ02D4EH55V,Good product (but….),"Great products but the noise cancelling is already starting to fade (I bought these in March 2024).

I tried contacting Bose as I wanted to write them an email and eventually just gave up. Do I recommend the A30?

Also, the A30 had too much padding at the top and made the A30 top heavy and would fall off my head with the slightest downward look. I fly for a major airline and I returned the A30’s within the hour after unboxing them. I couldn’t have my headset falling off my head during a flight and felt it was a worthless headset.

As soon I played a track to test them out I just got a off popping in the left ear, like there was a pressure popping my eardrums in and out as if there was sudden change in pressure.

I could hear sounds nuances within the music I regularly listen to that I swear I’ve not heard before. The noise canceling is excellent. You can switch them to “aware” mode and hear your surroundings if you choose. Or turn on the noise canceling and you’re in a cocoon of perfect silence with your music.

 These headphones are extremely comfortable on your head. I wore them all day today and felt no fatigue around the ears or soreness on my head. Extremely comfortable.

I give these headphones five stars because they are absolutely easy to use, an incredible sound experience while using, very comfortable, and the battery life is also good. I charged them on Christmas Day, it is now 24 hours later and they are still at 70%. And that is with noise canceling in use most of the time today.

R1ATUTXD6U3XGN,great sound,"I recently acquired the Bose QuietComfort headphone bundle, and it has provided me with an exceptional audio experience that I'd like to share. Here's what I love about this bundle:

One of the standout features of these headphones is the incredible sound quality. Bose is renowned for its audio prowess, and the QuietComfort 45 doesn't disappoint. The sound is rich, with deep and warm bass that adds depth to music and enhances the audio in movies. The midrange is crisp and clear, allowing for a detailed and immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music or watching a movie, these headphones deliver audio that's a cut above the rest.

The bundle also includes some valuable accessories that enhance the overall experience. The QC15 airplane jack adapter is a thoughtful addition for travelers, making it easy to connect to in-flight entertainment systems. Additionally, the two 2.5mm audio cables and the carrying case add to the convenience and portability of these headphones.

In summary, I'd highly recommend this Bose QuietComfort 45 headphone bundle, it offers a top-tier audio experience with its exceptional sound quality. The deep and warm bass, clear midrange, and included accessories make it a perfect choice for both music enthusiasts and movie lovers. These headphones are a testament to Bose's commitment to providing outstanding audio quality.",5,B0CKY6277R,2023,the United States

I think what you're really paying for is the durability of the headphones and the included accessories, which still could be bought at a cheaper price somewhere else. The carrying case and such are a nice touch but does not make the sound quality of these headphones any better. I have owned more affordable ones from less popular brands that give a richer sound quality than these. I would have to say that these are not in any way bad but I would definitely take off a star as they don't make me feel any more in tune with my music that I listen to from my phone other devices. Sound is clear and comfortable but does not really seem to amplify any sort of layered effects in music or podcasts when I listen to them.

R2W8XQPECUT2RP,Terrible Quality Control!!,"The simplest of checks would have saved me sending them back to be rebuilt and sold to someone else.  When I got them -
There was no flashing blue light next to the switch on the side of the headphone, only the white power light by the volume control.
It would not connect to BlueTooth
There was no noise cancelling.
I looked for the Bose Music app that Bose Instructions said to download - It no longer exists.  One must download a different one.  Ah, but which one - That's up to you to figure out.  Hint - It is the one with the B on it - there is none with an envelope or a stylized M on it.
I called Customer Service - Only after I gave them the serial number did the app work to connect the headphones to my phone.  Then, of course, I was chatting listening on the headphones and had to take them on and off to find out if the lights were working.
The Bluetooth voice that was SUPPOSED to come on when one pushed the switch to the right did not UNTIL customer service did something at their end.
I saw a SOLID blue light next to the volume buttons that became a SOLID white light again.
We got it to pair.
 I figured out how to turn the noise cancelling on and off.
Still no blue flashing light.
The blue light next to the switch never worked.  So, why keep them?  I sent them back.
THEN - Amazon says I have to drive 20+ miles to send them back unless I want to pack them and label them.  The last two items I sent back only required that I drop them off at my local Whole Foods.

—Unfortunately They just would not work properly. The few times I tried using them, the people on the other end complained I was ‘cutting out’ I had perfect service?? So each time I would disconnect them from my phone and the other person would hear me just fine.  I’m not sure what the deal is.
